  abstract = {Virtual reality opens a new world of a great potential for both research and experimentation by allowing new forms of unbuilt sensible architectural space. The paper starts with a sketch of the current context in Virtual Reality and continues by outlining the development and structure of the research “project Anywhere”. The project is an easily deployable, wireless, multi-user, augmented reality app-system that offers full body immersion through body, head and hands tracking. It can host multiple concurrent users, able to move freely in the virtual space, by moving in the real, and also perform actions through a gesture interface to affect their shared environment. Concluding, we describe the inherent properties of such a space, which we propose as a novel spatial medium for architecture, through an example of a potential application.},
