      <title>ACADIA Conference Archive</title>
      <link>https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/project/acadia-archive/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 14:21:30 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/project/acadia-archive/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In May 2023, I was awarded the inaugural &lt;a href=&#34;http://acadia.org/news/69P4TY&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ACADIA Cultural History Project Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; together with Hanan Kataw (Ph.D. Candidate, Harvard University), and Hayri Dortdivanlioglu (Ph.D. Candidate, Georgia Institute of Technology).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fellowship entailed production of work related to the &amp;lsquo;archive&amp;rsquo; of ACADIA, which at the time was an Excel sheet listing all papers published between 1985 and 2020, and a cloud drive with PDFs of conference proceedings volumes and other publications of ACADIA (e.g. quarterlies, membership lists, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My proposal was to create an open-access archive to host all content published by ACADIA. Using the data available, I wrote a Python program to parse this information and generate entries for an archive implementing &lt;em&gt;Sandpoints&lt;/em&gt;, an open-source open-infrastructure framework for experimental publishing.
The archive contains entries for all papers (1488), authors (2057), conference proceedings (40), and editors (116), as well as a library with readily available proceedings PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All archive contents are open access; all infrastructure and tools used to create this archive are open-souce; all data and original software used to create this archive are shared openly and documented at the archive website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the ACADIA archive is hosted at &lt;em&gt;Sandpoints&lt;/em&gt;, courtesy of Marcell Mars, at &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.sandpoints.org/sandpoints/acadiaarchive-46619c43/archive/acadia/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://pages.sandpoints.org/sandpoints/acadiaarchive-46619c43/archive/acadia/&lt;/a&gt; and is planned to move to archive.acadia.org .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;contribute&#34;&gt;Contribute&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an open and living archive, the ACADIA archive welcomes contributions both in the form of maintenance and care for the archive itself as well as contributions making use of its contents and hypertextual publishing format. Some ideas for contributions include: corrections and ammendments to existing entries; contributions of biographies of ACADIA members and contributors; contributions of articles about ACADIA and its history as well as archeological or thematic syllabuses making use of its material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;exhibition-outline&#34;&gt;Exhibition outline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition &amp;ldquo;Digital Commoning Practices&amp;rdquo; departs from Station of Commons; a practice of re-appropriation of technology as Commons within public space, which stands for radical alternative strategies to the neo-liberal system in terms of &lt;strong&gt;digital means of production, communication and distribution&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Digital Commoning Practices&amp;rdquo; starts with a question: How to think of a collaborative process embedded in technology that can find form into new knowledge and know-hows within, against and beyond capitalist modes of production?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Digital commoning practices&amp;rdquo; intends to both elaborate a critical discourse on the economization process, and to reflect on digital tools development to resist, and rebel, against privatization of technological means. Activist and architect Stavros Stavrides insists that commoning practices must welcome a multitude of knowledges, discourses, practices and know-hows for the emergence of commoning spaces. The dynamic at work operates as a collective and &lt;strong&gt;transformative effort always in the making&lt;/strong&gt;. The exhibition invites artists, activists, urbanists, publishers, designers, programmers, feminists and educators to open, share their work in an Open Source way of doing and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-exhibition-as-timelime&#34;&gt;An exhibition as timelime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The exhibition process produces a month long timelime to articulate&lt;/strong&gt; different temporalities; live audio streams, lectures, discussion and workshops.This format imagines an exhbition as an intersection of eventfull temporalities more than a division of space in the traditional white cube practice. &amp;ldquo;Digital Commoning Practices&amp;rdquo; timeline develops over three phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition opens with the celebration of the first anniversary of the Open Source audio stream. Together with Helsinki based &lt;em&gt;N10 collective&lt;/em&gt;, Station of Commons will broadcast 5 sound artists whose work has developed in absence of concert situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second phase aggregates a network of activists, theorists and artists involved in physical and technological spaces. This moment intends to &lt;strong&gt;intersect their knowledges and practice&lt;/strong&gt;s to examine and think together commoning practices in the current hybrid spaces. This phase interrogates how digital commoning practices can come to terms with old gender stereotype and how can all technology pirates work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third phase entittled &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Commoning Education/Educating the Commons&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; discusses how can digital practices and radical education can learn from each other. Learning together from the practices of the participants we will &lt;em&gt;deploy an edifice&lt;/em&gt; to initiate an operative digital commoning practice&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

/Ground floor in gallery space.&lt;br&gt;
Alexander Galloway writes in his book „The Interface Effect”, that „an interface is not a thing, an interface is always an effect. It is always a process or a translation.” This effect includes how humans are affected by an interface and the way they are able to engage with a machine. OFFREAL considers interfaces as conjunctions of possibilities, histories and power relations.&lt;br&gt;
In OFFREAL, two virtual assistants, called Ashley and Allison, are given the ability to diffract their existence as interface(s) and their looks. In addition to the female-coded voice, many avatars are designed according to pop-cultural ideals of beauty, which raises political and representational questions. The categories race and gender remain contested in the discourse on virtual bodies. What does it mean to be human and to become human in this digital age? Human-ess and Machines meet somewhere OFF the REAL in a speculative space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rethinking the common: Exploring the potentialities of space commoning&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
by Stavros Stavrides&lt;br&gt;
If commoning is about complex and historically specific processes through which representations, practices and values intersect in circumscribing what is to be shared and how in a specific society, where can we locate the potentialities of space commoning? Based on the view that commoning practices are characterized both by the means they employ and by the subjects that participate in them, this presentation will explore how inhabited space may become a shaping factor of solidarity and collaboration relations between commoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Unsettling the Universal: Really Useful Commoning&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
by Dubravka Sekulić&lt;br&gt;
Feminism, reminds us Lola Olufemi “is a political project of what could be.” Commons can be understood along similar lines. Both have to be understood as verbs, concepts that do, unsettle and transform, ways we are in the world. Thinking at the intersection between digital and urban, in my talk I will propose a reading of the public library as an important node in the feminist and commoning consciousness raising operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Variations of Gender and Technology Trouble&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
by Cornelia Sollfrank&lt;br&gt;
Technofeminism is based on two basic assumptions: 1) technology is not neutral and 2) technology is a highly gendered field. These presuppositions open up a field of questions, problems and related practices. Based on selected positions in theory and practice, the talk exemplifies some of the tensions and openings from which to rethink ways of encountering the current technopolitical crisis. Commoning here serves as a framework for the process of vision and implementation, of experimentation and evaluation, of responding to the contemporary condition by creating new forms, formats and formations and questioning them again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;“Educating the Commons and Commoning Education”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
by &lt;strong&gt;Gregoire Rousseau&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Nora Sternfeld&lt;/strong&gt; in dialogue.&lt;br&gt;
All over the world, education – which could be understood as a universal right and public good – is facing processes of economization and privatization. Technology – which could be understood as a common means of production, collaboratively developed – is taken away from the public and put into corporate hands. This conversation investigates the question of shared and common knowledge from the perspectives of an educator and an engineer, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

Cornelia Sollfrank (PhD) is an artist, researcher and university lecturer, living in Berlin (Germany). Recurring subjects in her artistic and academic work in and about digital cultures are artistic infrastructures, new forms of (political) self-organization, authorship and intellectual property, techno-feminist practice and theory. As a pioneer of Internet art, Cornelia Sollfrank built up a reputation with two central projects: the net.art generator – a web-based art-producing ‘machine,’ and Female Extension – her famous hack of the first competition for Internet art. Her experiments with the basic principles of aesthetic modernism implied conflicts with its institutional and legal framework and led to her academic research. In her PhD “Performing the Paradoxes of Intellectual Property,” Cornelia investigated the increasingly conflicting relationship between art and copyright. This led to her current research project ‘Creating Commons,’ based at the University of the Arts in Zürich. Her most recent artistic work, the performance À la recherche de l’information perdue, is about gender stereotypes in the digital underground with the example of Wikileaks. The artistic research group #purplenoise, founded in 2018, investigates the potential of social media for political manipulation.&lt;br&gt;

      <guid>https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/event/metadata-punks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;#000000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the past we were acting like data-punks. Not so much “here’s three chords, now form your band.” More like: “Here’s three gigs, now go form your autonomous art collective.” The new tactic might be more question of being metadata-punks.” (McKenzie Wark - Metadata Punk, 2015)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constantinos Miltiadis, Dubravka Sekulić, and Marcell Mars are amateur librarians sharing and maintaining their collections at &lt;a href=&#34;https://library.memoryoftheworld.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://library.memoryoftheworld.org/&lt;/a&gt;. Like other amateur librarians they run away, on daily bases, from interesting, exciting professional duties into the boring acts of searching for new books available on the internet, meticulously editing their metadata, running optical character recognition against badly scanned books, slicing double-paged books into single-paged ready for screen. If an important author and her books are not already available on internet then they scan and make it available. Sometimes, not always, they also read, annotate, cite, and discuss with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tabletalk the three speakers will present different aspects of the inevitable role of a researcher as librarian. From the definition of a library, to the act of creating a public library and of making sense of one’s reading corpus. The talk will be followed by a workshop on Wednesday, to introduce book scanning methods, and software for annotating, citing and organizing libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcell Mars&lt;/strong&gt; started his research “Ruling Class Studies” at Jan van Eyck (2011-12), continued at Akademie Schloss Solitude (2013) and since spring 2015, he is a PhD student at Leuphana University in DCRL (Digital Cultures Research Lab). Public Library/Memory of the World was established in 2012 to develop sociotechnical infrastructure and invigorate (again) historical argument for universal access to knowledge. He develops software: [let’s share books] Calibre plugin and related server infrastructure. Public Library/Memory of the World was heard and exhibited at Museo Reina Sofía, 98weeks, Impakt Festival, Transmediale, The New School, Kunstverein Stuttgart…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constantinos Miltiadis&lt;/strong&gt; is an architect and computational designer, currently an assistant professor at the Institute of Architecture and Media of TU Graz. His work is interdisciplinary and experimental, and focuses on real-time, interactive, virtual and augmented reality design as a means of expanding the scope of architecture. Constantinos has studied architecture at NTU-Athens and at the Chair for CAAD ETH Zurich, and his current research intends to bridge Game Studies and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dubravka Sekulić&lt;/strong&gt; is an amateur librarian researching transformations of contemporary city. In September she joined the Institute for Contemporary Art, Department of Architecture, TU Graz as an assistant professor. She is PhD fellow at the Institute for History and Theory of Architecture, Department of Architecture, ETH Zürich. She is an author of “Glotzt Nicht so Romatnisch! On Extralegal Space in Belgrade” (Jan van Eyck Academie, Maastricht, 2012) and co-editor of “Zoran Bojovic: Three Points of Support” (Museum of Contemporary Art Belgrade, 2013), Surfing the Black (Jan van Eyck Academie, Maastricht, 2012) and Peti Park, Struggle for Everyday (Kontekst, Belgrade, 2012).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tabletalks on Architecture (2016-2017)</title>
      <link>https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/project/16-tabletalks/</link>

      <guid>https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/project/16-tabletalks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tabletalks on Architecture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was a lecture series produced by a group of university assistants at the Faculty of Architecture, TU Graz between 2016 and 2017.
The initiative was conceived as as means to foster current research and as a casual event outside of formal university structures where academics, students, and practicing architects can converge, engage, exchange, and discuss matters related to architecture and architectural research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founding members of the initiative include Constantinos Miltiadis, Diederik de Koning, Marcello Fantuz, Sophia Walk, and Christoph Braser.&lt;br&gt;
Graphic design by Lilly Hafner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tabletalks on Architecture&lt;/em&gt; ran between 2016 and 2017 with four sessions listed below.
All events took place at &lt;a href=&#34;https://cafe-kork.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cafe Kork&lt;/a&gt; and were free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/uploads/ttoa/ttoa_1_deKoning.pdf&#34;&gt;TToA 1 event poster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuesday, 06.12.2016, 18:00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kork, Lessingstraße 25, 8010 Graz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tabletalk will focus on the role of architect-educators in the design of agricultural buildings and land settlement for the post-war European countryside. The research aims at building up the required body of knowledge for establishing an international discourse on agricultural design as part of the architectural discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diederik de Koning graduated cum laude in architecture from Delft University of Technology, and also holds a master’s degree in Environmental and Infrastructure Planning from the University of Groningen. Since the spring of 2013 he has taught a variety of courses at The Berlage Center for Advanced Studies in Architecture and Urban Design in Delft. He now works for the Institute of Architecture and Landscape at Graz University of Technology. He is currently working on his PhD research at the Borders &amp;amp; Territories research group at TU Delft, which deals with agricultural buildings in the post-war European countryside. Results of the research have been presented at conferences in Warsaw and Venice in 2016. In parallel, he runs an independent architecture practice together with Laura van Santen under the name la-di-da (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.la-di-da.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.la-di-da.nl/&lt;/a&gt;) which was recently included as one of the 33 invited young Dutch and Flemish offices to present their work as part of the 2016 “MAATWERK/MASSARBEIT” exhibition at the Deutsches Architekturmuseum, Frankfurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ttoa-2----petra-eckhard-the-anti-canon-of-architectural-modernism&#34;&gt;TToA 2 &amp;ndash; Petra Eckhard: The Anti-canon of Architectural Modernism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/uploads/ttoa/ttoa_2_eckhard.pdf&#34;&gt;TToA 2 event poster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuesday, 10.01.2017, 18:00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kork, Lessingstraße 25, 8010 Graz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her talk Petra Eckhard will explore architectural structures located in the Western hemisphere which emerged during the second half of the 20th century as an anti-canon of modernist architecture. As manifestations of personal desires and individual creativity, the works analysed have been realised without the burden of economic, functional, temporal or aesthetic restrictions&amp;ndash;aspects which usually accompany architectural practice. In their important function as foils, the anti-canonic works discussed unfold a special relationship to modernist forms, which paradoxically does both counteract and mirror the “greatness” and hubris associated with the modernist canon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petra Eckhard is a literary and cultural studies scholar at the Institute of Architectural Theory, Art History and Cultural Studies at Graz University of Technology. She studied English and American Studies in New York, Bern and Graz, where she also received her doctorate in 2010. Her fields of interdisciplinary research involve practices of architectural writing, postmodernist works of literature and architecture as well as their cultural implications. She is the author of “Chronotopes of the Uncanny” (2011) and co-editor of Graz Architecture Magazine (GAM). Currently, she is working on her second book which explores the anti-canon of modernist architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Tuesday, 13.06.2017, 18:00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kork, Lessingstraße 25, 8010 Graz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the epoch of the Anthropocene, human and non-human agencies are entangled in an extensive fabric, which determines the condition of our world. Such fabric is not balanced in a static equilibrium, but conceived as a flowing and intensive coexistence of currents and conditions, which define the expressions of our environment. The Anthropocene not only gains its geological importance by having inscribed the human’s impact in the geological strata of the planet, but similarly by formulating the conception of geological strata as artificial and virtual layers containing a productive, yet unknown potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic of the anthropocenic fabric brings about a new approach to ontogenesis, which no longer occurs by means of substantialist or hylomorphic principles, but through the process of becoming in the intra-action between the natural and the cultural, the conscious and the unconscious, the visible and the invisible. Matter is conceived as a living entity, which intra-acts with the human in complex networks, thereby abolishing traditional hierarchies and dichotomies imposed by the hegemonic system. To investigate such complexity by focusing on the construction of space is the aim of this research, while concurrently rendering visible the overall construction of the anthropocenic fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Virilio dates the origin of a global overformation with the development of the war landscape. It shows the anthropocenic fabric in its global dimensions, constructing an artificial climate and an ecology wherein the real and the virtual move and continuously flow together. Thereby, the construction of the bunker is seen as the mirror image of such war landscape, no longer being object or artefact, but an integral part or knot within the artificial fabric. Its geological investigation allows to consider the rhythm of the Anthropocene in its totality and to establish its rhythmic material as a tool for future inquiry and research.
In referring to the notion of duration, “Visual ontologies of the indefinite” outlines an intra-acting method, which stands in a geological present and understands the geological relict as an atmospheric particle of our immediate environment. Developing practices of embodiment and intuition, the field of warfare is thus not conceived as a mere historic seclusion, but as vibrating object of investigation for our planetary entanglement, encompassing politics, ideology, space, media, visuality, and art to a cohesive body of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christoph Walter Pirker (1989) is Assistant professor at the Institute for Architecture and Landscape at the Graz University of Technology. Furthermore, he is trained as an architect, musician, and visual artist. His transdisciplinary interest is based on studies at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Graz, the TU Graz and the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, Denmark. Highly engaged in practices of performative research, he is currently working on his PhD project (supervised by Milica Tomić) entitled “Visual ontologies of the indefinite &amp;ndash;Investigating spatial relationships of the human, the non-human, and the unknown”. The doctoral thesis is a continuation of the 2015 master thesis, which was awarded the Graz Architecture Diploma Award in October 2016. His work is at studiobirkenblau.com&lt;/p&gt;
