&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wolfgang Walcher&lt;/strong&gt; graduated from TU Graz (applied mathematics and PhD in computer science). He spent most his career in the US, working on and leading commercial and government remote sensing projects. Working with the founders of Google Earth, Sketchup he approached Microsoft about 3D mapping. He spent the next 10 years at Microsoft, holding principal-level positions, in areas like Bing maps, the production of 3D cities and the HoloLens project. After returning to Austria, he founded “Robotic Eyes”, a software house for engineering-grade Augmented Reality (AR) solutions. The company received funding from the European Space Agency incubator program (ESA-BIC) and has entered strategic partnerships with Autodesk, Microsoft and Google. Robotic Eyes provides the AR-platform REX, as well as consulting services and custom solution development to global enterprises.
