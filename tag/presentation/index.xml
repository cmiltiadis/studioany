      <description>&lt;p&gt;The digital commoning platform &lt;a href=&#34;../../project/station-of-commons&#34;&gt;Station of Commons&lt;/a&gt; wants to welcome all to the Helsinki book launch of the publication &lt;em&gt;WAVES: Radio as Collective Imagination&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the book launch at HKW Berlin for the Miss Read Berlin Art Book Fair in October 2024, Station of Commons now presents and celebrates the book in Helsinki. Beginning at 17:00 the panel discussion will introduce the publication and reflect on radio and audio practices &amp;ndash;their infrastructures, modes of collaboration and situated knowledges&amp;ndash; in written, visual and sonic form. Departing from the context of documenta fifteen, the book develops on radio practice as form of radical collective organization. The book is the first volume of &lt;em&gt;Journal of Contemporary Audio Practices&lt;/em&gt; that views radio and the sonic as political forms of collective organisation, focusing on the different practices of international artists and groups, many of them members of the lumbung radio community. The book launch takes place in the new space for sonic arts in Helsinki coordinated by Äänen Lumo ry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17:00 Presentation of Station of Commons and book presentation&lt;/p&gt;

### Space-Time-Craft: Notions of digital craft and design practice in contemporary research 

What is contemporary craft? 
Unlike vernacular notions of craft -- involving situated knowledges of a place and its available material which are cultivated over generations and performed by masters -- the notion of craft in our times poses a challenge, even more so in the context of research. 
The presentation will discuss notions of digital craft based on my research that investigates virtual space and movement *through exploratory design experimentation*. 
While virtual environments are ubiquitous, digital media like virtual reality and videogames are lacking formal foundations or discourses pertaining to their design and development.
In my work I approach virtual space as a &#39;contemporary material&#39;, something that necessitates practical experimentation for investigating its capacities and potentials. I develop experimental prototypes to investigate virtual environments that are experienceable, however, impossible to construct or come across in the physical world. 
The aim of this practice is twofold: the exploration of the design space of such media through experienceable artifacts which also serve as research objects, parallel to the investigation of what is possible to experience. 
Lastly, the presentation will discuss current difficulties in admitting design prototypes, and especially &#39;playable artifacts&#39; as research objects. 

--&gt;
&lt;!--
20 minute presentation about how you think of your practice and research as a craft, a well contextualised short presentation that is not too dense and high speed otherwise their minds will explode and we don&#39;t want to clean up brain matter in the classroom. The presentation is part of the course Thinking Practices in Art and Media, the day you&#39;ll be presenting in will feature another short presentation by Lucy Davies and a Keynote by Benedict Singleton around craftiness as a main concern of art and design
--&gt;

What is contemporary craft? 

As &#39;craft&#39; we usually identify colloquial practices 

Digital space 

The talk will discuss ongoing research pertaining to digital navigable space: virtual environments that allow for movement. 

# Bio 
**Constantinos Miltiadis** is a transdisciplinary architect and researcher; occasionally also programmer, media artist, curator, teacher, and librarian. His work is concerned with aesthetic phenomena between technology and culture, and his primary research investigates the design and experience of spatiotemporal navigable environments _inconstructible_ in the physical world, specific to and experienceable through digital media. He holds a diploma of architecture engineering from NTU-Athens, and a postgraduate degree on architecture and information from the Chair for CAAD ETH Zurich, with additional studies in computer music at IEM KU Graz. Constantinos’ work has been presented in seminars and exhibitions, published in conferences, journals as well as by international press. He has developed and taught courses on creative programming and experimental VR videogame design in academic contexts as well as conferences and art festivals. Between 2015 and 2019 Constantinos was assistant professor at the Institute of Architecture and Media of TU Graz. Since 2019 he is a doctoral researcher at the Dept. of Design, and the Dept. of Architecture at the School of ARTS at Aalto University in Helsinki.

      <title>From player representation to enactive presence: The case of &#34;boomer shooters&#34;</title>

      <guid>https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/event/from-player-representation-to-enactive-presence-the-case-of-boomer-shooters/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;presentation-abstract&#34;&gt;Presentation abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just forget it. You know they are demons; we know they are demons; we both want to shoot them in the face. Let&amp;rsquo;s just go (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoVQWnSOfM&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hugo Martin 2016&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videogame medium generated novel forms of storytelling and character representation, matters that were discussed in length in the context of game studies. This proposal, concerns a persistent and sizeable part of videogames that offer neither stories, nor player-character representations per se. Just action journeys. Such game experiences often evade analytical lenses due to difficulties of accounting for nothing but moment-to-moment action in virtual space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases are not about how the protagonist is represented (who is usually silent) nor a storyline (which often is a necessary wrapper around a sequence of predictably escalating challenges). What they celebrate instead are affective non-verbal aesthetics of virtual enaction.A prevalent example of this type is the ‘&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXCOKpJcYZU&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;boomer/movement shooter&lt;/a&gt;’ genre, a resurgence of the co-called ‘old school,’ ‘mindless’ first-person shooters, which was kickstarted with the modern reboot of Doom (id Software) in 2016.&lt;br&gt;
Games of this genre often display contempt toward high brow or consistent narratives. Here, any potential or necessary injection of story elements is rather utilitarian, serving as pacing break, setting up the gameworld, and empowering the player, often toward the ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just forget it [&amp;hellip;] Let&amp;rsquo;s just go,&amp;rdquo; Doom director Hugo Martin remarked on its ridiculous staging. Whether, Nazis, demons, aliens or other necessary evils, what these games suggest is a mode of representation through identification with what the protagonist &lt;em&gt;can practically do&lt;/em&gt; in the gameworld, and less than, or even against notions such as who they are, or why they do. They boil down to enactive representation: the mastery of actions like jumping, dashing, sliding and shooting, which define and set apart the protagonist in both worlds &amp;ndash; what Martin termed &amp;lsquo;Doom dance.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Virtual Infrastructures</title>
      <link>https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/event/virtual-infrastructures/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/event/virtual-infrastructures/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;event-description--programme&#34;&gt;Event description &amp;amp; programme&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Open Up and Shape Helsinki&lt;/em&gt; Symposium discusses how equity, labour, money and structures of power are configured globally, while reflecting these questions back onto Helsinki’s cultural scene, inviting three position papers and three Helsinki-based respondents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carolina Rito, co-editor of Institution as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sternberg-press.com/product/institution-as-praxis/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praxis – New Curatorial Directions for Collaborative Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Sternberg Press, 2020); followed by Joasia Krysia, Curator of Helsinki Biennial 2023&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bassam El Baroni, editor of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/between-material-and-possible&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the Material and the Possible: Infrastructural Re-Examination and Speculation in Art&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Sternberg Press and Edith Russ Haus, 2022); in with architect and researcher Constantinos Miltiadis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cynthia Cruz, author of &lt;a href=&#34;https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-melancholia-of-class-a-manifesto-for-the-working-class/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Melancholia of Class: A Manifesto for the Working Class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Repeater Books, 2021); with poet and novelist Niko Hallikainen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday 10th Justina Zubaitė-Bundzė, Helen Kaplinsky, Maria Mkrtycheva, Irina Mutt and Henri Terho will participate in a public panel discussion around the three focuses of the Symposium: Infrastructures of power, and (re-) distribution; class, money and access; institutional reimagining and future publics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shape-helsinki.fi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHAPE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a mapping of art spaces and public events across the city, initiated in 2021 by PUBLICS and Kohta, the Symposium offers a platform for voicing individual and common challenges. Over 100 Helsinki-based art organisations and institutions have been invited to join in &lt;em&gt;Rants &amp;amp; Raves&lt;/em&gt; of four minutes and thirty-three seconds each, inspired by John Cage’s composition 4’33’’. ‘Ranting’ and ‘Raving’ are immediate and liberating forms of public expression. They tell about the present, while pointing at long-coming conditions of pressure, uncertainty and search for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rants &amp;amp; Raves&lt;/em&gt; will form a choral, humorous and situated picture of Helsinki’s art scene; reflected by curator, artist and educator Dahlia El Broul, chair of the board at Catalysti, and Henna Harri, director of the Association of Photographic Artistsand Photographic Gallery Hippolyte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Open Up and Shape Helsinki&lt;/em&gt; Symposium programme is planned in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://kohta.fi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kunsthalle Kohta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the framework of the three-year &lt;a href=&#34;https://openupeu.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Creative Europe) project, for which PUBLICS is a partner. Through &lt;em&gt;Open Up and Shape Helsinki&lt;/em&gt;, PUBLICS will map out, invite, and nurture new audiences for its activities. &lt;a href=&#34;https://frame-finland.fi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frame Contemporary Art Finland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; joins the collaboration by co-hosting one session in the context of &lt;em&gt;Rehearsing Hospitalities&lt;/em&gt; public programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ilona Sagar&lt;/strong&gt;, lives and works in London. Using a diverse range of media spanning moving-image, text, performance and assemblage, she has formed a body of work which responds to the social and historic context found in the public and private spaces we inhabit. By instrumentalising historical archives and their institutions, not as an encounter with a safely sealed past, but as something current and unstable that speaks urgently to our present condition, she explores the links between language, surface, technologies and the body through our increasingly mediated encounters in social, political and experiential space. Ilona Sagar is the Stanley Picker Arts Fellow 2021 and the Saastamoinen Foundation, Helsinki, artist in residence for 2022. Forthcoming commissions include ‘The Radio Ballads’ Serpentine Gallery, where she is one of four new commissions with Sonia Boyce, Helen Cammock and Rory Pilgrim (2021/22), and is embarking on a new solo commission with Firstsite Gallery, Colchester (2023).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;space-writing-within-architectures-expanded-field&#34;&gt;Space-Writing Within Architecture’s Expanded Field &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space, as the substrate that conditions design and architecture is often taken for granted. Through a brief archeology of the evolution of spatial concepts from Greek mathematics through Renaissance perspective and 20th century physics, this talk intends to present how design-space is a culturally embedded “ideology” that adheres more to tradition rather than to any current scientific theory. Contemporary space-making media however can allow for us to experiment with and explore perceivable spaces beyond the traditions of design, as well as of what is constructible in physical reality, requiring thus a new set of conventions for engagement with space. Akin to writing spaces rather than designing in space, “choropoietic media” from drawing to videogames, VR and spatial audio, challenge us in considering an “expanded field” of architecture and spatial praxis, while providing vehicles for uncovering latent spectra of aesthetic experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constantinos Miltiadis (&lt;a href=&#34;http://studioany.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;studioany.com/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constantinos Miltiadis is a transdisciplinary architect, whose research and practice focus on virtual spatiotemporal environments, as a means of expanding the scope of architecture and its aesthetics. He has studied architecture at NTU-Athens, at the Chair for Computer Aided Architectural Design of ETH Zurich, and pursued studies in computer music at the Institute of Electronic Music of Kunst Uni Graz. His work has been presented in exhibitions, seminars, published in academic conferences as well as by international press, and received awards in international competitions. He has taught creative programming and experimental computation in academic contexts, as well as in conferences and art festivals. In addition, he was founder and curator of the “&lt;em&gt;IAM Open Lectures&lt;/em&gt;” and co-founder of “&lt;em&gt;Tabletalks on Architecture&lt;/em&gt;” as well as of the experimental electronic music event series . Between 2015 and 2019 he has been assistant professor at the Institute of Architecture and Media of TU Graz, while currently he is a doctoral student between the departments of Design and Architecture at Aalto ARTS, part of the Experience Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spatial-aestheticsin-auditive-media-composition&#34;&gt;Spatial Aesthetics in Auditive Media Composition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the cases both of music and of science, detachment involved the use of mechanical aids: scientic instruments helped discover a world, musical instruments to build one (D. Burrows)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We as composers and sound artists have never confronted a machine of the collective, networked, and externally defined media perception design as we experience it today. So what do we share with our audience, the engineers and scientists working on perceptions in media spaces, and how can we still detect potential for aesthetic experiences and make them useful for the acoustic arts? It seems unavoidable that this question causes us to fall back on our ears and the aesthetic reflection of what is experienced and experienceable in situ. Spatialization is the synthesis of spaces and spatial properties of sounds for audiences using numerous loudspeakers. Although one of the most important developments in music within the past century it is still an area of confusion and fundamentally different opinions between researchers, sound engineers, composers, and audiences. Great advantages in computer and audio technology have not necessarily yet led to similarly greater artistic advances in spatialization strategies and concepts within the past decades when compared with pioneering electro-acoustic music in the 1950s, in which visions of sculptural sound phenomena from the 1930s were firstly created and publicly performed. Moreover, as spatial computer music matures and consolidates within institutions and organizations, it is increasingly involving 3D audio systems which can create auditory virtual environments (AVEs). Quite likely in the very near future AVEs will be part of many people’s everyday life, e.g. in cars, working spaces, intelligent homes, concert halls and computer games. The emerging general question is, who creates these ‘virtual’ environments with which intention and how can music, sound art and sound design aesthetically contribute to this reality with their own strategies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gerriet K. Sharma is a composer and sound artist. He studied Media Art at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne and composition/computer music at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz. In 2016 he completed his doctorate at the scientific-artistic doctoral school Graz. His thesis is titled “Composing Sculptural Sound Phenomena in Computer Music”. Within the last 15 years he was deeply involved in spatialization of electroacoustic compositions in Ambisonics and Wave-Field Synthesis and transformation into 3D-soundsculptures. From 2009 to 2015 he was curator of “signale-graz” concert series for electroacoustic music, algorithmic composition, radio art and performance at the MUMUTH Graz. His works were presented and premiered at festivals in Europe and abroad. Scholarships by the German Academic Exchange Programme (DAAD) in 2007 and 2009. In 2008 he was awarded with the German Sound Art Award. In 2007 and 2010 he was Artist in Residence at Pact Zollverein Essen working on his concept of sculptural sound projection and formation. Within his Residency at the Institute of Musicology Wuerzburg 2011 – 2013 he conceived and established the Atelier for Sound Research. In spring 2014 he was composer in residence at ZKM Karlsruhe/Germany. 2015 – 2018 he was senior researcher and composer within the three year artistic research project “Orchestrating Space by Icosahedral Loudspeaker” (OSIL) funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF). He had been appointed as DAAD Edgar Varèse guest-professor at Electronic Music Studio, Audio communication (AK), TU Berlin for WS 2017/18. In 2019/20 he is visiting professor (Music and Technology) at IKG DART doctorate school Madrid. Publications in international journals and books on spatial practices and sound. “Aural Sculpturality. Spatio-temporal Phenomena within Auditive Media Techniques” was published by ZKM in 2019, his text “Surrounded by Immersion – Means of Post-Democratic Warfare” was released in the book Ultra Black of Music by Mille Plateaux in March 2020. He lives in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Architectural Continuum: Choropoietic media and post-physical-world spatial aesthetics</title>
      <link>https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/event/continuum-cologne/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2019 10:00:03 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/event/continuum-cologne/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Workshop organized by Marc Bonner, DFG fellow at Universität zu Köln.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international conference will be held in context of the DFG funded research project “Open-World-Structures: Architecture, City- and Landscape in Computer Games” (Bonner 2017-2020) and addresses the matter of (1) architecture in game worlds in the sense of its media specific spatialization, architectural layouts and the role of architecture, as well as (2) the architecture of computer games themselves in the sense of systematics, structures and media specific logics between algorithms and databases – worldbuilding from a different angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the participants will thematise aesthetics of reception as well as aesthetics of production and approach the complex constitution of computer games from a wide range of disciplines – from Media and Game Studies to Art History, Sound Studies to Architecture, Design to Phenomenology and Embodiment, as well as Spatial Theory and Cultural Studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the conference is to channel multi-disciplinary approaches and current research projects to fuel an interest towards an understanding of computer games as spatial, architectural or world phenomena within the current digital media culture. Furthermore, it is to explore and discuss concepts and methodologies from other disciplines and the potential transfer as useful tools in Game Studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Contribution to CHNT 2018 on intangible cultural heritage based on the project &lt;a href=&#34;../../project/daphnes-diary&#34;&gt;Daphne&amp;rsquo;s Diary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents theoretical and practical considerations regarding the role of moat of the medieval walls of historic Nicosia. It introduces the history of Nicosia, the last divided capital of Europe, through the development of its Venetian fortifications. The moat acquired an important role for Nicosia when the city started expanding beyond the medieval footprint of the labyrinthine urban fabric of the historic core during the late period of British rule on the island. Since the beginning of the 20th century numerous activities and uses were hosted into the moat, from sporting events, livestock trade and markets to parades and leisure spaces, waste disposal and farming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the war of 1974 and the division of Nicosia, the urgent and ever-growing needs of the city for empty plots to support its infrastructure and operation led to the fragmentation of the moat. In this context the paper reflects on the current state of the moat and inquires for the pressing need to reconsider the identity and value of the moat for the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to this need it discusses new approaches to the use of Information Communication Technologies (ICT)  for facilitating the re-appropriation of the moat of Nicosia’s medieval fortifications from being used as parking space, and other fragmentary private uses, into a green belt that highlights the only shared heritage that unites the two sides of the divided city, that is, its Medieval Walls. In particular an ICT-enabled initiative is presented that involves the creation of spatially-distributed storytelling for the promotion of the history of the Medieval walls of the city by exploiting the software and communities of Geocaching driven by preliminary results of a survey of users of the public space of the moat. The organization of this initiative was supported by a H2020 COST Action (TU1306) Short Term Scientific Mission, the results of which will be presented in the paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding, the paper presents a grassroots approach to the application of digital interfaces and interactive narratives, which contributes to the exploitation of heritage in Mediterranean cities for the reactivation of neglected urban green spaces through playful engagement and storytelling. Specifically it suggests the use of a “cloud” layer over the city, on which to collect and expose the multiple narratives of its dense historical past, functioning therefore as a neutral ground for the analysis of the city’s palimpsest and the negotiation of the cultural processes for the production of the lived space. Employing a format of locative, historically corroborated dramatized audio narratives, the initiative intends to provide an experiential approach to history, eventually aiming to trigger the audience’s visual imaginary over their immediate surroundings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It argues that heritage can be used to influence positively the social cohesion of the urban context. Promoting heritage in such a way that, instead of provoking tensions and division (based on a hegemonic reading of the -complex and debated- past), can offer opportunities of understanding, by enabling politically, historically and socially excluded communities to narrate their histories.. Focusing on everyday experiences, the project intends to eventually contributing to an inclusive view of the past of the built environment and therefore to a sense of mutual belonging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;presentation-abstract&#34;&gt;Presentation abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ουδείς αγεωμέτρητος εισήτω” reads the inscription believed to have marked the entrance of Plato’s Academy. Although often mistranslated, it’s literal meaning is: “Let no ungeometered person enter.” Plato addresses not geometers, but the geometered, as if mathematics were a practiced, embodied quality, and a modality of being, instead of mere knowledge. Indeed, Euclid’s rigorous axiomatic system, doubles also as a first formal scientific method, that Plato will employ as an instrument to better understand reality, while expecting from his students and guests the ability to employ the empirical sequential methodology of constructible geometry in their rhetoric. Mathematics thus, becomes a form of ideology. Centuries later, Alberti’s “De Pittura”, on mathematical perspective, bridges geometry with the experience of the world and initiates the scientific revolution. Cartesian rationalism will employ geometry to represent and understand the world, while Kant will advocate for “absolute space” as the petri dish of reality. In the millennia to come, Euclid’s geometry will become the most intuitive model of space. However, the search for a proof of his infamous fifth postulate, will trouble mathematicians for centuries. Gauss’ “Theorema Egregium” will provide a paradigm shift and alternative to Cartesian space, while his student Riemann, addressing the “hypotheses which lie at the bases of geometry” will generalize the theory for N-dimensions. Einstein will adopt such a geometry to theorize reality as spacetime, accounting for phenomena unheard of in Euclidean space, and providing the first significant rupture between visual space and reality. Meanwhile, video games become the most prominent entertainment medium and the field of game studies is established. Scholars will write on space; as the ‘raison d’être’ of games; as a parallel to architectural practices; and as a paradigm shift of this cultural medium coming of age. Space has indeed become the underlying substrate in both the production and consumption of games, with gameplay seen a spatial practice. From military flight simulators to contemporary videogames, ‘gameplay’ has been proven to develop and expand one’s spatial skills. Although architectural design is locked in a Euclidean paradigm, a few video games show our capacity to conceive and engage with spaces impossible to construct physically. Through a short historiography of the evolution of spatial concepts, this contribution intends to suggest the possibility of a Virtual Architecture. Based on both theory and experimental practice we will discuss sensible, postphysical-world navigable environments residing in the VR-video game medium, and the vast aesthetic potential stemming from their capacity to tap into currently latent spatial-cognitive abilities. As Van Schaik suggests, our ability to harness and cultivate “spatial intelligence” is the essence of architecture par excellence, and the well of its future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Towards the Expanded Field</title>
      <link>https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/project/towards-the-expanded-field/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Towards the Expanded Field: experimental and interdisciplinary approaches to immaterial spatiotemporal environments&lt;/em&gt; was a three day symposium including lectures, spatial audio performances and a VR exhibition that took place between 7 and 9 of March 2018 at the &lt;em&gt;Haus der Architektur&lt;/em&gt; Graz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual reality and spatial audio technologies bring about a new paradigm in the fields of architecture and music. While defying classification, works developed in these media extend our spatial and auditory sensibilities beyond what is perceivable in the physical world. Can we regard them however as architecture and music, or are they foreign to their origins?&lt;br&gt;
Architect Constantinos Miltiadis and composer and sound artist Gerriet K. Sharma will present their investigations and exhibit works on virtual navigable environments and sculptural spatial audio. The event intends to initiate a discussion on the nature of such explorations, in parallel to the nature and future of music and architecture in the expanded field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--Signale graz Soirée mit Susanne Fröhlich und Constantinos Miltiadis, Montag, 29.05.2017, 18:00 CUBE, IEM, Inffeldgasse 10/3--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die signale graz Soirées bilden seit dem Sommersemester 2012/13 ein Forum, in dem der Dialog zwischen den Instituten der KUG und anderen Grazer Universitäten gefördert wird, um so einen intensiveren Austausch der künstlerischen und wissenschaftlichen Projekte zu ermöglichen. Bei der Veranstaltung werden von den Gästen kurze Vorträge gehalten, in denen ihre aktuellen Interessen und künstlerischen oder wissenschaftlichen Forschungen dargestellt werden, was dann Anstoß zu gemeinsamen Diskussionen bietet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wir freuen uns, am kommenden Montag in diesem Rahmen Susanne Fröhlich (künstl.-wiss. Doktoratsschule, KUG) und MAS ETH AI Dipl. Constantinos Miltiadis (Institute of Architecture and Media, TU Graz) begrüßen zu dürfen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Susanne Fröhlich (künstl.-wiss. Doktoratsschule, KUG)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The recorder in the 21st century&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Middle Ages on, the recorder had many different forms of appearance and was always adapted to the sound worlds and music aesthetics of its particular time. Therefore, recorder players from today can choose from a big variety of instruments to perform in different styles and performance practises. So, it seems quite logic to perform music from today on instruments from today. But, reality looks different and in terms of method, extended techniques and performance practise on modern recorder models we are still at the starting point and there is a lot to develop, to explore, to fathom and to document. This fact marks the actual starting point of my artistic research and leads me the question: How much will new recorder models enrich repertoire, playing techniques and performance practise of recorder players?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susanne studied the recorder with P. Leenhouts at Amsterdam Conservatory, with G. Lünenbürger at the Berlin University of Arts and with J. Fischer at the Akademie für Tonkunst in Darmstadt. Since October 2015 she is doing an artistic-academic research on the Helder Tenor at the Kunstuniversität Graz. Susanne regularly performs recitals and teaches workshops in Europe and overseas. As founding member of the former recorder quartet QNG – Quartet New Generation, she appears both as soloist and different formations as well as music theatre productions. She has participated in numerous world premieres at renowned venues and festivals worldwide with e.g. Ensemble Adapter, Collegium Novum Zürich, Figura Ensemble, Ensemble ICTUS and Neue Vokalsolisten. Susanne has won several scholarships and international competitions in Berlin, Bonn, Cracow, Darmstadt, Göttingen, Graz, New York, and Rotterdam. She is living and teaching in Berlin and won a lectureship at the University of Arts in April 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAS ETH AI Dipl. Constantinos Miltiadis (Institute of Architecture and Media, TU Graz)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Timescales of architecture”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to sound and music, architecture, understood primarily as the discipline of materialization of spatial designs, is traditionally thought of as an event of presence outside of the time dimension. The talk aims to examine different notions of a timeline in architecture history; from the timeless, to the periodic, metabolic and temporary, and eventually, through personal works and current research dealing with procedural design, interactive structures, virtual reality and game studies, present a conjecture of an immaterial but sensible architecture, of narrative events and interactive agency in contingent and subjective spatiotemporal environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constantinos Miltiadis is an architect, computational designer and researcher, currently a University Assistant at the Institute of Architecture and Media of TU Graz. His work is interdisciplinary and experimental, and focuses on real-time, interactive, virtual and augmented reality design as a means of expanding the scope of architecture. He holds an MAS in Architecture and Information from the Chair for CAAD of ETH Zurich and a Diploma in Architecture Engineering from the NTU-Athens. Constantinos has taught programming classes in academic environments, conferences and festivals, and has worked for various academic and research oriented practices. His work has been awarded in international competitions, presented in exhibitions and conferences, and published by between others The Guardian and Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Plexus Project is an initiative to bring together the creative talent of different disciplines to share techniques, solve problems and build networks of collaboration. The events take place every month inviting young designers, architects, engineers, programmers, game designers and visual artists. This initiative is open to anyone in London that is looking for an informal place to network and learn about new methodologies and workflows.&lt;br&gt;
The event was initially called Bartlett Nexus and was created by Jose Sanchez, currently he co-curates it together with Manuel Jimenez Garcia, who joined the event organization in September of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
