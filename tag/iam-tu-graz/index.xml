  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/346087697&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;vimeo video&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False Mirror Office&lt;/strong&gt; gathers five architects sharing the Polytechnic School of Genoa as common background. While collaborating with leading European firms, its members share the interest for selected themes of major relevance, spanning from disciplinary topics to unrelated matters. Believing that new only originates as a reaction to the existing, false mirror office re-discovers the past as the present, re-signifies high as mass culture, re-values forms and functions.
As a matter of fact, False Mirror Office mis-represents Architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015 Andrea Anselmo, Gloria Castellini, Filippo Fanciotti, Giovanni Glorialanza and Guya Di Bella gathered for Europan 13 competition (Trondheim, Norway). That project – the false mirror, awarded with first prize and currently ongoing – gave birth and named the collective. From that date on, the firm has been focusing on projects of different size and program, accompanying the design process with a constant work  of research; spanning from the re-interpretation of traditional typologies, investigating hybrid combinations of functions, searching for new narratives and representational tools.
Their works have been published on several architectural periodicals, e-zines and platforms – among the others Divisare, Afasia, Arkitektur.no, Beta-architecture, Archdaily, Dezeen, Viceversa Mag, Platform, Sky ARTE, The Architect’s Newspaper, Carnets, OUTSIDE, Designboom, Architektura i Biznes and The Architectural review.
From 2016 the group has been involved in a series of collaborations with other firms based in Genova; the group – featuring false mirror office, Gosplan, Linearama, PIA and uno8A – has taken part in international competitions and has been involved in relevant exhibitions, from AESCHYLI (Genova, 2016) to la cameretta, as part of the Unfolding Pavillon at the 2017 Architectural Biennale in Venice. In 2017 Divisare Books dedicated to the group the first box set for the series New Architects, focused on emergent Italian firms, thus including False Mirror Office’s first monograph: foretaste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides their practice, False Mirror Office is highly committed to academic research, with a few of its members associated with universities such as EPFL and the Polytechnic School of Genoa. In addition, False Mirror Office has given multiple lectures, as well as taken part in international workshops and exhibitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boris Hamzeian&lt;/strong&gt; is a PhD assistant of the Laboratory of Theory and History of Architecture LTH3 at the École Polytechnique Fédérale De Lausanne -EPFL (CH). Since January 2017 he has been developing a PhD thesis titled “A ‘live centre for information’: the Pompidou Centre. Idea, design, fabrication, installations” under the direction of Roberto Gargiani.
Born in Genoa in 1989. Obtained a M. Arch. Diploma with honours at the Polytechnic School of Genoa, IT (2014) with a specialisation on architectural and urban design. In 2012 he worked as an intern at Renzo Piano Building Workshop-RPBW Genoa. In 2013 he worked as a researcher at the International Institute of Architecture I2A in Lugano (CH). Between 2014 and 2015 he also worked as a graduate assistant and guest lecturer at the Polytechnic School of Genoa (IT). In 2015 he has been awarded with the Swiss Government Excellence Scholarships for Foreign Scholars at the EPFL (CH). Between 2015 and 2016 he worked as assistant at the Laboratory of Arts for Sciences (LAPIS) at the École Polytechnique Fédérale De Lausanne -EPFL (CH). In 2017 he was awarded by the Swiss National Science Foundation with a Doc.Mobility grant to carry out a one year exchange program at the ENSA Paris-Malaquais in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filippo Fanciotti&lt;/strong&gt; is Scientific assistant at the Laboratory of Arts for Sciences (LAPIS) at the École Polytechnique Fédérale De Lausanne -EPFL (CH) under the direction of Nicola Braghieri. Since 2016 he’s tutoring and holding classes about architectural representation for the courses of “Figuration et représentation de l’architecture” (FIRE II and FIRE III) and the bachelor course of “Vision et Utopie”. Born in Genoa in 1988. Obtained a M. Arch. Diploma with honours at the Polytechnic School of Genoa, IT (2014) with a specialisation on restoration. In 2013 he worked as an intern at MVRDV Rotterdam. Between 2014 and 2016 he worked as a graduate assistant and guest lecturer at the Polytechnic School of Genoa (IT). Between 2015 and 2017 he worked as collaborator at una2 architetti associati in Genoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beside their academic activities, Boris and Filippo, are co-founders of the architectural firm False Mirror Office (2015-present).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giacomo Pala&lt;/strong&gt; is an architect and researcher based in Innsbruck, Austria, where he works at the department of architecture theory as an assistant researcher – collaborating in research activities and in teaching the “ArchiFIcture” studios. He conducts his PhD at the same university under the guidance of Peter Trummer. More specifically, his research is focused on the relationship between historical time – intended as a form of fiction and architectural design in the attempt of developing a more complex relationship between the two, by looking at specific cases including Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s work. Basically, his interest lies in the possibility of testing the mutual limits between design, history and theory.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, she is a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Science and Technology Studies (IAS-STS). Her dissertation dealt with the rhetoric and then physical instantiations of inclusion, accessibility, and empowerment within various maker cultures. Her current work examines the politics of education technologies and skill-sharing techniques among DIY enthusiasts via a feminist theoretical lens. She has been an invited speaker at the London School of Economics, Emory University in the United States, and the University of Technology in Eindhoven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frank Fetzer&lt;/strong&gt; is a PhD candidate in the last year at the University of Vienna. He holds a master’s degree in film studies from the same institution. His work focuses mainly on phenomenological and post-phenomenological theories. Key elements of his research are embodiment, human-technology relations, cyborgs, the ontology of virtual worlds and of course the video game as such. In his dissertation project, he tries to disentangle the manifold relations between player and video game as technological artefact and extension of player and world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mariana Bisti&lt;/strong&gt; studied Building Restoration (TEIPAT 2005) and Architectural Engineering (BA/MSc, NTUA 2012) in Greece. In 2014, having spent several years in the design industry, she moved to London to pursue a MFA in Fine Art Media at the Slade School of Fine Art (UCL 2016). Her art practice ranges across different media, including video, photography, public interventions, performances and installation. It can be described as an exploration of the contours of meaning and identities, through the processing of their equivocal formations and contingent representations. In her works, traces, marks, manifestations of temporal presence are recorded and manipulated in an attempt to investigate the ubiquitous absence of certainty in our contemporary world. Implications of political and social issues are juxtaposed with solid forms and concrete spatial references, informing each other of the current human condition and its contextual ambiguities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asya Ilgun&lt;/strong&gt; is an architect, computational designer and researcher. Her main territory of “design research” is framed as smart ways of using the additive manufacturing (in particular deposition based) technologies to make new types of structures that breed the questioning of architectural boundaries, supporting the dual occupancy of humans and bees. Asya was trained as an architect, acquiring her Masters in Architecture within the programme CITAstudio: “Computation in Architecture,” at KADK in June 2016. Currently, she is doing her pre-doctoral research at the interdisciplinary environment of the Artificial Life Lab of the Karl Franzens Uinversity of Graz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architect and entertainment designer &lt;strong&gt;Johannes Mücke&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the two founding partners of the Viennese design studio WIDESHOT established in 2010. Together with his partner Oliver Bertram and his team, Johannes works for various Hollywood blockbusters especially Roland Emmerich productions. What started with a raw animated cartoon for the apocalypse prophet Charly Frost in the movie „2012“ reached its most recent climax with the blockbuster „Independence Day: Resurgence“. For „Independence Day: Resurgence“ Johannes with WIDESHOT took on the leading role for the design of all the spaceships, the illustrations for greenlight-presenations at Fox, the construction of the sets at the Studios of Albuquerque and the production of the title sequence in Los Angeles. In his lecture Johannes will give a close insight into his work and will present his approach on unconventional and innovative design for film, by his Vienna based design company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Werner Jauk&lt;/strong&gt;
Psychologist working on experimental aesthetics, the hedonic control of explorative behaviour
Musicologist working on music being a process of mediatization of expressive behaviour and its communicative function in everyday-life
Media-artist working an experimental settings to perceive the process of extension of perception by media, which creates virtualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Werner Jauk, musician and artist, is the Professor of Musicology at the Karl Franz University of Graz. He has studied psychology, pedagogy and philosophy and through the years has worked in the fields of new technologies, cybernetics, digital music, experimental aesthetics and pop-culture.
