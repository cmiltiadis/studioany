Digital design 2 (dm2) is a week-long course taught to third-semester architecture students at the Institute of Architecture with the aim of introducing computational design thinking and related practices. 
The course was originally taught using MEL scripting in Maya. 

The course theme for 2016 was "Sound to Space" and aimed at using sound input to generate geometry. 
In January 2016 I ran an iteration of the course using the programming language [Processing](https://processing.org/). For this purpose I also wrote a short booklet introducing basic programming concepts in Processing (see [Processing Booklet](/uploads/16-cmiltiadis-DM2-Processing-Booklet.pdf)). 
This workshop iteration used FFT over a live sound input to generate interactive graphics.
