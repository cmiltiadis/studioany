dm2 is a 4 day intensive workshop for third-semester architecture students, taught by the Institute of Architecture and Media of TU Graz. Its purpose is to introduce students to programming, and this year’s theme is “Sound to Space”. Block F was taught using the Processing programming language, in order to generate interactive geometry/graphics using data obtained from FFT sound input processing in real-time.

Workshop challenge: Program or explain how to generate the above vector image. [[solution posted here](http://studioany.com/2015/12/14/async/)]

For the purpose of the workshop, I wrote a small introduction booklet, that contains some general information on getting started with programming. [[Booklet download link (A5 PDF)]](http://studioany.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DM2_ProcessingBook_s.pdf)
