dm2 is an obligatory, full week intensive workshop for third-semester architecture students, taught by the Institute of Architecture and Media of TU Graz. The aim of the workshop is to introduce architecture students to computational thinking and practices. 
The theme for 2016 is "Sound to Space." Unlike the rest of dm2 workshops that used Maya, Block F was taught using the programming language Processing, for generating interactive geometry and graphics in real-time, using data obtained from FFT sound input processing. 

For the purpose of the workshop I wrote a small booklet as a general introduction to getting started with programming in Processing.

For the purpose of the workshop, I wrote a small introduction booklet, that contains some general information on getting started with programming. [[Booklet download link (A5 PDF)]](http://studioany.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DM2_ProcessingBook_s.pdf)
