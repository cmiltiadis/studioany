Week-long workshop focusing the exploration of architectural acoustics through experimental game design. 
The course was developed and taught together with Achilleas Xydis (AA Lab, ETH Zurich).   
 
Seminar week; Winter semester 2024  
[Architectural Acoustics Lab](https://aa.arch.ethz.ch/); [Gramazio Kohler Research](https://gramaziokohler.arch.ethz.ch/)  
Department of Architecture, ETH Zurich. 

# Workshop brief  
This seminar uses experimental game design to explore acoustic qualities of architectural space, which are often neglected in visual-based design processes however, are irreducible counterparts of spatial experience. The course begins with a practical exploration of architectural acoustic through playful exercises to cultivate auditory sensibilities of architectural environments. It then introduces the Unity game engine through design experiments focusing on the acoustics of virtual environments. Throughout the week, participants develop their own playable experience using acoustics as a design driver to express different qualities of architectural space. The week closes with a public exhibition of all projects.
