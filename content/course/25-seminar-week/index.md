Week-long workshop focusing the exploration of architectural acoustics through experimental game design. 
The course was developed and taught together with Achilleas Xydis and Anna Maragkoudaki (DARCH, ETH Zurich). 
 
Seminar week; Summer semester 2025  
[Architectural Acoustics Lab](https://aa.arch.ethz.ch/); [Gramazio Kohler Research](https://gramaziokohler.arch.ethz.ch/)  
Department of Architecture, ETH Zurich. 

# Workshop brief  
This seminar week uses experimental game design to explore architectural acoustics by developing speculative spatiotemporal environments. The course begins with playful exercises to sensitize participants to the auditory dimension of architectural environments, largely overlooked in visual-based design processes despite its significance for spatial experience. It continues by introducing tools and techniques for developing interactive spatiotemporal assemblages using the Unity game engine. These tools include workflows for digitizing real architectural environments through 3D scanning and tools for virtual acoustic simulation. Throughout the week, participants develop their own playable experience using acoustics as a design driver to express different qualities of architectural space. The week closes with a public exhibition of all projects.
