 5. Virtual Spaces Master Studio (IAM TU Graz 2016)

Virtual Spaces Master Studio (VSMS) was an experimental VR game design course (16 ECTS master design studio module), taught during the summer semester of 2016 to a group of 13 architecture master students, at the Institute of Architecture and Media, Faculty of Architecture, TU Graz. The theme was based on “[project Anywhere](http://studioany.com/projects/project-anywhere/)” (2014), and later research on architecture and virtual space, and its aim was to introduce architects to VR as a platform for experimental architectural design, that doesn’t have to result in building form. The VSMS module included the electives “Interdisciplinary Media: Space to Sound” and “Architecture & Film.” The module was taught by Constantinos Miltiadis and Prof. Urs Hirschberg.

Working essentially in the ‘videogame’ medium, the design approach of the studio is a fusion of disciplines, techniques, and skills that require the parallel development of both technical and conceptual tools such as concept design and narrative development, storyboarding, interaction design, UI design, 3d modeling, sound design, video editing, scripting, app development, etc. The course introduced theoretical discussions of culture and space, analyzing and drawing inspiration from diverse discourses including video games, films, novels, architecture, and critical theory. Besides in VR, the students were asked to experiment with spatial evocations in other creative media such as text, sound, video, and 2D graphics.

The breadth of the 13 works developed by individual students demonstrates that VR and the videogame medium hold significant potential for architectural explorations of many different kinds, including the design of experienceable spatiotemporal environments and configurations of being-in-a-world that are impossible to come across in physical reality. Furthermore, the course showed that many aspects of designerly and tacit knowledges as well as technical design skills are well transferable between architecture and game design and development.

The studio as well as the electives are taught in English. All projects were made with Unity3D for Android/GearVR. All module output is digital.

**Setup**  
Following “project Anywhere” the VR setup is wireless and full-body immersive, based on a combination of hardware. It consists of GearVR headsets with Samsung Galaxy S6 phones [courtesy of Drei Austria], deployed in a space tracked by Kinect V2 sensors which can follow 25 points of a user’s skeleton, synchronized with the android app through a web cloud in real-time.

**Final Review**  
June 30th, with invited jury: Jan Markus Ludwig ([wideshot entertainment](http://www.wideshot-entertainment.com/)), Lewis Scott ([VizConnected](http://www.vizconnected.com/)), and Florian Fend ([IAM](https://iam.tugraz.at/team/fend-florian/)).
