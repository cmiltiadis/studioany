Workshop upon invitation by the Polish Association of Architecture Students (OSSA), part of the event “Vision” October 13-21 2018, in Łodz, Poland, with the participation of spatial audio composer and sound artist [Gerriet K. Sharma](http://gksh.net/) in the first half of the workshop.

This workshop including its curriculum, process, and outcomes are documented extensively in the JAR paper:

- Miltiadis, Constantinos, and Gerriet K. Sharma. ‘Beyond the Visual – A Research Curriculum for Explorations in Spatiotemporal Environments’. _Journal for Artistic Research_, no. 24 (27 September 2021). [https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/815001/815002](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/815001/815002).

**Beyond the Visual – Workshop brief**  
This workshop intends to explore architectural sensibilities beyond the “Visual” that the event title suggests. Starting from acoustic field experiments, participants will be called to analyze the -emergent- sonic dimension of the built environment. Developing an awareness of the essential role that sound plays in our perception and cognition of space, we will experiment with an architectural composition that uses sound objects as building material. Contrary to the conceptual sphere of architecture which excludes such phenomena, we propose an approach intended to deepen the understanding of the non-visual aesthetics embedded in architecture. Introducing readings from various disciplines and working with both temporal and spatial digital media, the workshop intends to experiment with the spatiotemporal production of our lived environments, and eventually develop such prototypes in the virtual reality medium.
