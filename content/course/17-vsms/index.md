**Course Description**

The **Virtual Spaces Master Studio** : **16m2 Labyrinth** is an intensive and experimental master design studio module given at the [Institute of Architecture and Media](https://iam.tugraz.at/) of the Architecture Faculty of TU Graz. As with [VSMS 2016](http://studioany.com/teaching/vsms-2016/), the course developed as final output interactive Virtual Reality applications in the format of videogames, focusing on perceptible and immaterial spatial concepts and experiences. The 2017 VSMS was titled “16m2 Labyrinths” given the 4x4m tracking space of the HTC Vive VR system for which the projects were developed.

The aim of the studio is to approach Virtual Reality as a choropoietic medium, instead of a representational one, and explore from an architectural perspective, the possibility of designing spatial experiences that don’t rely on physical materiality but are however sensible. Our focus of exploring the architectural aesthetic potential of this medium was pursued by a wide variety of methods implemented in the student projects, ranging from the design of spatial narratives to navigable non-euclidean spaces and more abstract experiences.

Starting from the concept of the Labyrinth the studio investigated the geometrical, formal, and organizational aspects of labyrinths and mazes, and through key readings from both architecture and game studies, how such concepts can be applied to spatio-temporal interactive environments, as an intention of approaching the videogame medium with an architectural sensibility, for developing novel architectural experiences.

**Course Details**  
All course assignments and outputs are in digital form. No previous programming experience is necessary. Fluency with conventional 3D modelling, raster, and vector graphics software though is required. The course is going to work mainly with Unity 3D, 3D Max, and Premiere Pro.  
The course includes the electives Digital Form and Motion taught by Oliver Reischl, and Interdisciplinary Media taught by Constantinos Miltiadis  
The course is coordinated through a Slack group, collective readings performed through [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/).

**Course Language**  
The studio as well as the electives are taught in English and are open to exchange students.

**Excursion**  
Travel to Linz on the 23rd-24th of March, organized by Julian Jauk. The first day starts with a visit to the University of Arts in Linz, and a presentation of the work of Johannes Braumann, followed by a visit to the Ars Electronica Center with a tour by AEC Director Andreas Bauer, and participation to the event “Human bodies – the universe in itself” at the Deep Space 8K. The second day includes a tour of the city and a visit to the Lentos Museum, Schloss Museum, Höhen Rausch, and Museums Quartier.
