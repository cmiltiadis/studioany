## Outline 

Course designer and lead teacher for the *Virtual Spaces Master Studio* module (16 ECTS) at the Institute of Architecture and Media, TU Graz, during the summer semester of 2017.  The objective of the studio was to introduce virtual reality as a medium for experimental design, and to explore designing virtual environments in both space and time. At the end of the semester each student produced, presented, and exhibited a VR experience (for the HTV Vive).

## Course information 

#### Course Description  
*Virtual Spaces Master Studio: 16m2 Labyrinths* is an intensive and experimental master design studio module offered by the [Institute of Architecture and Media](https://iam.tugraz.at/), Faculty of Architecture, TU Graz. As with [VSMS 2016](http://studioany.com/teaching/vsms-2016/), the course developed as final output interactive Virtual Reality applications in the format of videogames, focusing on perceptible and immaterial spatial concepts and experiences. The 2017 VSMS is titled “16m2 Labyrinths” given the physical space constraints (4x4m tracking space) of the HTC Vive VR system. 

The aim of the studio is to approach Virtual Reality as a choropoietic medium, instead of a representational one, and explore from an architectural perspective, the possibility of designing spatial experiences that don’t rely on physical materiality but are however sensible. Our focus of exploring the architectural aesthetic potential of this medium was pursued by a wide variety of methods implemented in the student projects, ranging from the design of spatial narratives to navigable non-euclidean spaces and more abstract experiences.

Starting from the concept of the Labyrinth the studio investigated the geometrical, formal, and organizational aspects of labyrinths and mazes, and through key readings from both architecture and game studies, how such concepts can be applied to spatio-temporal interactive environments, as an intention of approaching the videogame medium with an architectural sensibility, for developing novel architectural experiences.

#### Course details  
The course is going to work primarily with Unity 3D, 3D Max, and Premiere Pro. All course assignments and outputs are in digital form. No previous programming experience is necessary. Fluency with conventional 3D modelling, raster, and vector graphics software though is required.  
The course includes the electives Digital Form and Motion taught by Oliver Reischl, and Interdisciplinary Media taught by Constantinos Miltiadis. 
The course is coordinated through a Slack group, collective readings performed through [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/).

#### Course language  
The studio as well as the electives are taught in English and are open to exchange students.
