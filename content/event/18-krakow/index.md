## Abstract 

The turn of the millennium saw influential publications1–3 exploring the proximity between game design and gameplay on the one hand, and spatial practices and architecture on the other. While subsequent contributions suggested typologies4–6 for the analysis of gamespace, no particular approach has gained prominence7.
Based on both theory and experimental practice, and following Riemann’s habilitation8 that exposed the hypotheses of euclidean geometry, this presentation intends to propose the possibility of escaping the flat-earth paradigm that conditions gamespace -due to both the western mathematics tradition and game development software.

Instead, we want to turn beyond the visual aesthetics of game cities and their styles, to the aesthetics of practiced space, the sensibility par-excellence of the new literacy9 of videogames, as Fraser proposed.10

Drawing from Gardner’s “spatial intelligence”11, a developable cognitive capacity proven to be correlated with gameplay,12 this presentation suggests game design and gameplay as means to explore spaces that are perfectly perceivable, which we can come to reason and act upon, that lie beyond the field of what is constructible in physical reality. Post-real-world navigable environments, intrinsic to the videogame medium, uncover latent domains of cognitive sensibilities, and a correlated domain of aesthetics waiting to be discovered.
