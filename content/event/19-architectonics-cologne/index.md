# ABSTRACT 
abstract: 'Since the turn of the century, scholars have argued for videogames as allegories of space, for game design as narrative architecture and for the focus of games on space as an altogether paradigmatic shift in both their production and consumption. This new paradigm, however, requires and engages with a practical and empirical approach; a different mode of literacy concerned with developable reasoning and abilities relevant to spatial, instead of the more commonly used logical-analytical, cognitive faculties.

The proximity between architectural and game design practices, on the other hand, appears today to be closer than ever. VR is already being used as a representational and evaluation medium for architectural design, and videogames are employed as design and simulation tools for urban planning. This presentation however is concerned with the inverse rhetoric.

As renaissance architecture following the invention of perspective argued for architecture as the drawing, distinct from its material manifestation, similarly today, we can speculate on a continuum that extends to architectures intrinsic and specific to the videogame medium. Drawing from the evolution of spatial concepts through mathematics and physics, we can suggest and design novel spatial configurations that escape the obsolete cartesian flat-earth underlying paradigm that both CAD and game development software presuppose. Commercial games have already shown spaces that while physically inconstructible are perfectly perceivable by our sensory apparatus, and in which we can reason and act upon. This new class of post-physical-world navigable environments, eventually suggests an expanded field of architecture, exploiting currently latent cognitive abilities and simultaneously implying a new, undiscovered domain of spatial and potentially architectural aesthetics.'

Workshop organized by Marc Bonner, DFG fellow at Universität zu Köln. 

**Event description**

The international conference will be held in context of the DFG funded research project “Open-World-Structures: Architecture, City- and Landscape in Computer Games” (Bonner 2017-2020) and addresses the matter of (1) architecture in game worlds in the sense of its media specific spatialization, architectural layouts and the role of architecture, as well as (2) the architecture of computer games themselves in the sense of systematics, structures and media specific logics between algorithms and databases – worldbuilding from a different angle.

Thus, the participants will thematise aesthetics of reception as well as aesthetics of production and approach the complex constitution of computer games from a wide range of disciplines – from Media and Game Studies to Art History, Sound Studies to Architecture, Design to Phenomenology and Embodiment, as well as Spatial Theory and Cultural Studies.

The aim of the conference is to channel multi-disciplinary approaches and current research projects to fuel an interest towards an understanding of computer games as spatial, architectural or world phenomena within the current digital media culture. Furthermore, it is to explore and discuss concepts and methodologies from other disciplines and the potential transfer as useful tools in Game Studies.
