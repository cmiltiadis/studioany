Upcoming event discussing notions of craft and practice in contemporary art making and research.
Held by the Department of Art and Media, Aalto ARTS.

<!--
20 minute presentation about how you think of your practice and research as a craft, a well contextualised short presentation that is not too dense and high speed otherwise their minds will explode and we don't want to clean up brain matter in the classroom. The presentation is part of the course Thinking Practices in Art and Media, the day you'll be presenting in will feature another short presentation by Lucy Davies and a Keynote by Benedict Singleton around craftiness as a main concern of art and design

## Abstract 
What is contemporary craft? 
Unlike traditional notions of craft -- performed by masters, and embodying knowledges cultivated over generations as well as situated knowledges of a place and its available materials -- the notion of craft in our times poses a challenge, even more so in the context of research.

- What is contemporary craft?   
  As 'craft' we usually identify colloquial or vernacular practices which are performed by 'masters', and which embody knowledges cultivated over generations, the spirit of a place ('genius loci'), and the materials available in this context.  
- How could we discuss craft in the digital domain, and furthermore in the context of research?

- Virtual navigable environments 
- Contemporary research traditions: disciplinarity and tradition

The talk will discuss ongoing research pertaining to digital navigable space: virtual environments that allow for movement. 

# Bio 
**Constantinos Miltiadis** is a transdisciplinary architect and researcher; occasionally also programmer, media artist, curator, teacher, and librarian. His work is concerned with aesthetic phenomena between technology and culture, and his primary research investigates the design and experience of spatiotemporal navigable environments _inconstructible_ in the physical world, specific to and experienceable through digital media. He holds a diploma of architecture engineering from NTU-Athens, and a postgraduate degree on architecture and information from the Chair for CAAD ETH Zurich, with additional studies in computer music at IEM KU Graz. Constantinos’ work has been presented in seminars and exhibitions, published in conferences, journals as well as by international press. He has developed and taught courses on creative programming and experimental VR videogame design in academic contexts as well as conferences and art festivals. Between 2015 and 2019 Constantinos was assistant professor at the Institute of Architecture and Media of TU Graz. Since 2019 he is a doctoral researcher at the Dept. of Design, and the Dept. of Architecture at the School of ARTS at Aalto University in Helsinki.
