# SUMMARY
summary: ''
# ABSTRACT 
abstract: 'Starting from the notion of “Parachronism”, it is discussed the problem of our relationship with historical time (past, present and future) as both timely and timeless. It is both at the foundation of modernity (with its post-, hyper- and meta-) and a contemporary issue as in politics, as in architecture. This presentation will try to propose and stimulate some questions on how to develop an approach to time and history that takes account of its non-linearity: a conception in which the past, the present and the future are seen as one. Then, it is discussed how architecture can be something beyond the mere building of a material object, becoming instead a cultural object, bearer of ideological, cultural, popular or mythological values.'

**Giacomo Pala** is an architect and researcher based in Innsbruck, Austria, where he works at the department of architecture theory as an assistant researcher – collaborating in research activities and in teaching the “ArchiFIcture” studios. He conducts his PhD at the same university under the guidance of Peter Trummer. More specifically, his research is focused on the relationship between historical time – intended as a form of fiction and architectural design in the attempt of developing a more complex relationship between the two, by looking at specific cases including Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s work. Basically, his interest lies in the possibility of testing the mutual limits between design, history and theory.
