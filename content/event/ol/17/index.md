# SUMMARY
summary: ''
# ABSTRACT 
abstract: 'The lecture will present the current state of the 3-year FWF-Project on North-Indian Nagara architecture currently conducted at IAM. The first part will focus on an introduction to this specific form of Indian sacral architecture, with their architectural history of the monuments and their wider cultural context. The second part will be dedicated to the methodologies implemented for digital reconstruction, being a mixture of automated processes and digital craftsmanship. It will present the current results while explaining the further goals and challenges arising by the limitations of possible on-site documentation and technical restrictions.'
