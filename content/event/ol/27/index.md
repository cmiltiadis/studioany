# SUMMARY
summary: ''
# ABSTRACT 
abstract: 'The creation of imaginaries from the geography of Finisterre (from the Latin “finis terrae,” meaning “end of the earth”) at the westernmost cape of Spain has been over the years, Eduardo Brito’s subject matter in writing, photography and film. In this lecture, the screening of his two short films “Slope” (2018) and “Penumbria” (2016) will serve as the point of departure for a reflection on the definition and representation of “ends of earth” and other remote places.'

**Eduardo Brito** works on photography, film and writing. He holds a Master’s degree in Artistic, Museological and Curatorial Studies from the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Porto with a dissertation entitled “Claro Obscuro – Representations of the Museum in Fiction Film”. Eduardo is an assistant professor at this faculty and a researcher at I2ADS. Between writing, photography and film, Eduardo’s work explores the connections between truth, fiction and memory, as well the relation of text to image. Example of these are his books “East Ending” (2017) and “The Orcadians” (2014), and the photography series “5 p.m. Hotel de la Gloria” (with Rui Hermenegildo, 2015), “Un Samedi Sur Terre” (2017) and “Stories with no Return” (2018). Eduardo also directed the short films “Penumbria” (2016) and “Slope” (2018), co-wrote with Rodrigo Areias the feature film “Blue Breath” (2018) and wrote the short films “The Scoundrel” (Paulo Abreu, 2012), “The Glory of Filmmaking in Portugal” (Manuel Mozos, 2015), “Catherine or 1786” (Francisca Manuel, 2017) and “The Everlasting Man” (Luís Costa, 2017).
