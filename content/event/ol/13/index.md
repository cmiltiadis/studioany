# SUMMARY
summary: ''
# ABSTRACT 
abstract: 'Architecture is already witnessing the shift from the “making of form” to the ”finding of form” that was envisioned a decade ago (Kolarevic 2013). Digital fabrication, computational design systems and adaptive materials are already transforming the way we perceive, conceive ace construct architecture. But what are the drivers of this new form-found and performance-driven architecture? How can we harness the potential of this unprecedented level of control over our built environment? Looking at the integration of simulation in our design systems and the performance optimization approaches of leading architectural research and practice, we aim to engage in a discussion about form, function and the future challenges of a responsible architecture.'

**Angelos Chronis** is a Marie Curie Fellow of the Innochain network at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia in Barcelona. He teaches at IaaC and the Bartlett School of Architecture. Previously he has been working as an Associate for the Applied Research + Development group at Foster + Partners. His main research interest lies in the integration of simulation, optimization and performance drive in the design and fabrication process and he is actively involved in scientific committees as an author, reviewer and organizer as well as participating in lectures, workshops and architecture crits internationally.
