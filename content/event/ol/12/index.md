# SUMMARY
summary: ''
# ABSTRACT 
abstract: 'Computer animation and visual effects have seen a tremendous development over the past decades in a constant pursuit of recreating reality. The lecture will look into some of the processes borrowed from VFX and evolved into a series of experimental projects in computer animation and programming, based around procedural animation, growth algorithms and other bottom up behavioral systems, that best exemplify how a small set of rules can scale up and create complex forms and behaviors. This reappropriation of sophisticated tools and technology towards experimentation outside the realm of photo-realism, attempts to explore new visual territories and embrace the nature of the medium rather than disguise it.'
