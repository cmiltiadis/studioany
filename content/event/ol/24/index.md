# SUMMARY
summary: ''
# ABSTRACT 
abstract: 'Artists working with Virtual Reality as an artistic medium and form of expression often embrace digital artefacts and imperfections that arise during the creative and computational process. In real and virtual, animate and inanimate, real and unreal, humane and non-human get blurred. Like a phantom limb, virtual bodies become perceivable representations, that can be sensed and felt by their digital nature. In her talk, Martina Menegon wants to introduce her artistic practice and methodology and further discuss the representations of the body in digital art practice,
Menegon’s „Plug your nose and try to hum“ VR installation can be seen and experienced during this event.'
