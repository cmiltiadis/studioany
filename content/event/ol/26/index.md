subtitle: ''
draft: false
# SUMMARY
summary: ''
# ABSTRACT 
abstract: 'Built heritage can be used to influence positively the social cohesion of neighbourhoods as it could be promoted in such a way that, instead of provoking tensions and division, would offer spaces of inclusion, interesting everyday experiences and provide a sense of belonging to socially excluded communities. The presentation will discuss the use of modelling, simulation and ICT for enhancing community participation and user engagement in the management of historical public spaces as commons. Modelling and simulation tools will be presented for the study of the many different ways citizens engage bodily with the common resources of the city, such as heritage sites.'
