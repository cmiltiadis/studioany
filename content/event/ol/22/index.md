# SUMMARY
summary: ''
# ABSTRACT 
abstract: 'In his article “The Virtual and the Real”, philosopher David Chalmers discusses whether immersive, computer-generated spaces are real or virtual. He argues that virtual space is real in the sense that it serves certain functional purposes. The talk will challenge this “functionalist” understanding of virtual spaces as real by, instead, focusing on our capacity to orient ourselves independently of marks, features and objects in space. It will be argued that we have a mental capacity, or power, that enables us to differentiate between directions in space. This capacity makes it possible for us to relate to spatial directions as real, and not merely virtual, reciprocal relations.'
