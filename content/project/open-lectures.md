The Open Lecture Series was founded in 2015, and slowly formalised as an intention of mapping the ecology of computation and thinking in the wider field of architecture and media. It focuses on hosting talks of younger academic researchers and practitioners, whose work and approach is experimental, interdisciplinary and in many cases in progress.  
The Open Lectures take place at the New Media Lab of the Institute of Architecture and Media, at Kronesgasse 5/III.

The lectures are archived at the [TU Graz Tube](https://tube.tugraz.at/paella/ui/browse.html?series=9866b725-a6f2-41ca-8e5c-00879478b22f) and on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/channels/iamlectures).  
Filming & Production: Department of [Educational Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/oe/lehr-und-lerntechnologien/home/), TU Graz.

The series was founded by the former IAM staff Constantinos Miltiadis, who curated the series until 2019. The IAM Open Lectures Series is continued by current members of IAM.
