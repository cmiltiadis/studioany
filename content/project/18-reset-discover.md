The piece *reset.discover* is an artistic research collaboration of composer Antonia Manhartsberger and computational designer Constantinos Miltiadis, pursued to explore possibilities of uniting spatial-visual and spatial-sonic elements into one *consistent spatiotemporal whole*.

The piece consists two counterparts: an electronic music composition for spatial audio, and a interactive virtual environment for VR.
The composition features abstract sonic environments and moving sound objects organized in three categories: *ambient-environmental*, *sound-object-events*, and *gestures*.
These are correlated to physical-visual objects in the spatial simulation of the 3D virtual environment, sequenced to follow the behavior of their sonic doubles.
Participants *enter* the piece using a VR headset which allows to experience the piece interactively by exploring different perspectives into its spatial-visual (interactive stereoscopic VR) and spatial-aural (interactive binaural audio) dimensions. 

The piece is discussed further in the thesis of Antonia Manhartsberger titled “*Das soziopolitische Potential von Raummusik im Angesicht zeitgenössischer Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten*”,  presented at IEM in June 2018.
