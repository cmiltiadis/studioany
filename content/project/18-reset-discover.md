The piece *reset.discover* is an artistic research collaboration of composer Antonia Manhartsberger and computational designer Constantinos Miltiadis, pursued to explore possibilities of uniting spatial-visual and spatial-sonic elements into one *consistent spatiotemporal whole*.

The piece consists two counterparts: an electronic music composition for spatial audio, and a interactive virtual environment for VR.
The composition features abstract sonic environments and moving sound objects organized in three categories: *ambient-environmental*, *sound-object-events*, and *gestures*.
These are correlated to physical-visual objects in the spatial simulation of the 3D virtual environment, sequenced to follow the behavior of their sonic doubles.
Participants *enter* the piece using a VR headset which allows to experience the piece interactively by exploring different perspectives into its spatial-visual (interactive stereoscopic VR) and spatial-aural (interactive binaural audio) dimensions.

whole comprising of an environment with  

that a participant can *enter* using a VR headset, and explore interactively through different perspectives in both the spatial-visual (stereoscopic VR), and spatial-auditory (binaural audio) dimensions    

that allows to explore interactively both its visual its binaural  wearing a VR headset, and thus explore 
stereoscopic
experience interactively through different perspectives. 

The project elaborates on the idea of arrangement of sound in the spatial rather than temporal dimension. 
The elements of the virtual environment are sequenced spatially in the 3D environment of the Unity game engine, organised in 3 categories: Ambient-environmental, sound-object-events and gestures.
Wearing a VR headset, the participant *enters* the piece which they can explore  
The participant navigate the sonic and visual 
, which the user can navigate 

The project consists of a spatial audio composition, and a VR environment that features visual 

The piece develops over notions of proximity and distance, thus consisting of two layers of experience. An individual point of view controlled by a VR HMD and headphones, and a correlated surrounding spatial audio loudspeaker setup. 
The audience is called upon to experientially discover this synthetic surrounding.

The piece is discussed further in the thesis of Antonia Manhartsberger titled “*Das soziopolitische Potential von Raummusik im Angesicht zeitgenössischer Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten*”,  presented at IEM in June 2018.
