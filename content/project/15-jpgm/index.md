*John Paul George & Me* is a collection of interactive wearable musical instruments for kids. 
Each T-shirt represents a specific instrument and all together form a rock ensemble. Through the seemingly magical clothes that produce sound by touch, the project brings to children an interactive musical game, encouraging and stimulating their musical interest as well as collaboration with each other to perform music.
The project was developed by textile designer Selina Reiterer and computational designer Constantinos Miltiadis for exploring playful applications of smart materials and interactive wearable technology.

The project includes three T-shirts, a microcontroller with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module, and a mobile app.  
The three individual T-shirts were inspired by and designed after the standard rock trio representing a guitar, a bass, and a drum set. 
Each shirt has a distinct pattern, based on the attributes of the instrument it represents, which each shape forming a uniform conductive region sensitive to touch. 
The patterns were silk-screen printed on plain T-shirts with electrically conductive paint, a flexible, washable and non-toxic chemical mixture.  
In the back of each garment is a removable pocket with an Arduino microcontroller that receives touch signals from each shape through conductive thread.   
The touch signals are then sent wirelessly via BLE to a mobile application which triggers different audio samples corresponding to each garment-instrument. 
Multiple T-shirts can be connected to a single mobile device, or each band member can use their own. The device can be connected with headphones and external speakers to amplify the sound output.

*JOHN PAUL GEORGE & ME* is a collection of interactive wearable musical instruments for kids. Each T-shirt represents a specific instrument, all together forming a rock ensemble. Through the seemingly ‘magical’ clothes that produce sound by touch, the project brings to children an interactive musical game that encourages and stimulates their musical sensibilities, while promoting collaboration for performing music together. The project is an investigation of smart materials, wearable technologies, and animated textiles, developed with textile designer Selina Reiterer, as a first implementation of ongoing research.

JPG&Me is a collection of interactive T-shirts, inspired by and designed after the standard rock trio, including guitar, bass, and drums. Each shirt has a distinct pattern, based on the attributes of the instrument it represents. The patterns were silk-screen printed on plain T-shirts with electrically conductive paint — a flexible, washable, non-toxic textile chemical mixture. Each shape is uniformly sensitive to touch.

A microcontroller attached to a removable pocket in the back of each garment is connected to the shapes with conductive threat, and senses touch input. The signals produced, are in turn sent to a mobile application via Bluetooth Low Energy (LE). The application itself is multi-platform and runs on both Android and iOS devices. The mobile app receives touch signals wirelessly and triggers sound sample playback in real-time. Multiple T-shirts can be connected to a single mobile device, or each band member can use their own. The device can be connected with headphones or external speakers to isolate or amplify the sound output.
