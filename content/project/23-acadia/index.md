In May 2023, I was awarded the inaugural [ACADIA Cultural History Fellowship](http://acadia.org/news/69P4TY),[^fellows] together with Hanan Kataw (Ph.D. Candidate, Harvard University), and Hayri Dortdivanlioglu (Ph.D. Candidate, Georgia Institute of Technology). 

The fellowship entailed production of work related to the 'archive' of ACADIA, which at the time was an Excel sheet listing all papers published between 1985 and 2020, and a cloud drive with PDFs containing conference proceedings and other publications of ACADIA (quarterlies, membership lists, etc.).

My proposal was to create an open-access archive to host all content published by ACADIA. Using the data available, I wrote a Python program to parse this information and create an archive implementing *Sandpoints*, an open-source open-infrastructure framework for experimental publishing. 
The archive contains entries for all papers, authors, proceedings (issues), and editors, as well as a library with readily available proceedings PDFs.

All archive contents are open access; all infrastructure and tools used to create this archive are open-souce; all data and original software used to create this archive are shared openly and documented at the archive website. 

**Archive contents** 


| Item |Description|  Amount|
|-|-|-|
| Issues | ACADIA publications | 40  + 1 issue about the archive| 
| Articles |Peer reviewed proceedings articles (up to 2020) |  1488 |
| Contributors |Article authors| 2057 | 
| Editors|Proceedings (issue) editors| 116 + 1 entry for archivist | 
| Library | Library catalogue with downloadable ACADIA publications (note: metadata not finalized) | 140 | 


The ACADIA archive is currently hosted at *Sandpoints*, courtesy of Marcell Mars, at https://pages.sandpoints.org/sandpoints/acadiaarchive-46619c43/archive/acadia/. It is planned to move to archive.acadia.org .
