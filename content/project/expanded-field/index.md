**Lectures, Performances & Exhibition**  
**7-9 of March 2018**  
**Venue: Haus der Architektur, Mariahilferstraße 2, A-8020 Graz**

Virtual reality and spatial audio technologies bring about a new paradigm in the fields of architecture and music. While defying classification, works developed in these media extend our spatial and auditory sensibilities beyond what is perceivable in the physical world. Can we regard them however as architecture and music, or are they foreign to their origins?  
Architect Constantinos Miltiadis and composer and sound artist Gerriet K. Sharma will present their investigations and exhibit works on virtual navigable environments and sculptural spatial audio. The event intends to initiate a discussion on the nature of such explorations, in parallel to the nature and future of music and architecture in the expanded field.

**Keynote lectures**

Constantinos Miltiadis – The Architectural Continuum: science, technology, art, choropoietic media and spatial aesthetics
