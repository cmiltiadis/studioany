Daphne’s Diary is a concept design and prototype for historical interactive location-based audio narrative Geocaching tours, developed during the [COST Cyberparks Training School](http://cyberparks-project.eu/) titled “Virtual Flâneur of Mediterranean Cities” that took place at the Cyprus Institute, Nicosia, during the week of 30.10-3.11.2017.

On February 2018, the Cyberparks COST Action has awarded the project a short-term scientific mission (STSM) grant, for further development and implementation of the project with bi-communal cultural institutions in Nicosia, in collaboration with the Cyprus Institute. The STSM was conducted between March 22 and April 4 2018 [[x](https://www.cyi.ac.cy/index.php/cyi-news/cyberparks-cost-action-awards-grants-to-starc-trainees-for-short-term-scientific-missions-on-mediated-landscapes-in-nicosia.html)]
