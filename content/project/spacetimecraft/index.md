Long-term transdisciplinary research project on virtual architecture. 
The project investigates the aesthetic experience in virtual spatiotemporal environments that cannot be reproduced in physical reality, through integrative design research. 
It is pursued through mixed methods including prototyping, experimental gamemaking, teaching experimental course curricula, media archeology, presenting and publishing; and it interfaces with discourse fields including architecture, game studies, design research, media studies, and artistic research. 

The project started following the development of [project Anywhere](../project-anywhere) at the Chair for CAAD at ETH Zurich in 2014. It continued through teaching the experimental course [Virtual Spaces Master Studio](/tag/vsms) on VR game design for architects developed and taught at the Institute of Architecture and Media at TU Graz in 2016 and 2017, as well as other short intensive [workshops](/tag/workshop).
In late 2019 the project developed into a doctoral research project at Aalto University, School of Arts, expected in 2025, titled: *SpaceTimeCraft: Integrative Research through Design into the Experience of Vitual Navigation*.
