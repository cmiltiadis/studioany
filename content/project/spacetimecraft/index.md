Long-term research project investigating forms of architectural experience specific to digital media, that culminates in the upcoming doctoral dissertation at Aalto ARTS titled *SpaceTimeCraft*, expected in 2025.

More specifically, the project explores the aesthetic experience specific to virtual navigable environments---spatiotemporal environments that are *inconstructible* and impossible to come across in physical reality, yet are experienceable through immersive digital media such as VR and videogames. 

The project follows an integrative research methodology, and spans multiple approaches including: 
- exploratory game and VR development, 
- hardware prototyping, 
- media archeology concerning the evolution of design software, VR and videogames,
- original publications in the context of architecture, artistic research, and game studies, as well as  
- extensive related teaching.

Long-term transdisciplinary research project on virtual architecture. 
The project investigates the aesthetic experience in virtual spatiotemporal environments that cannot be reproduced in physical reality, through integrative design research. 
It is pursued through mixed methods including prototyping, experimental gamemaking, teaching experimental course curricula, media archeology, presenting and publishing; and it interfaces with discourse fields including architecture, game studies, design research, media studies, and artistic research.

The project was initiated following the development of [project Anywhere](../project-anywhere) at ETH Zurich in 2014. It was developed further through interdisciplinary research and publishing as well as extensive teaching of original curricula on experimental VR development, including the [Virtual Spaces Master Studio](../../tag/vsms) at TU Graz (2016-2017), as well as multiple shorter [workshops](../../tag/workshop). I was informed further through additional studies in computer music and spatial audio at the Institute of Electronic Music of KU Graz between 2018 and 2019. 
In late 2019, this was formalized into a doctoral research project at Aalto University, School of Arts, within the context of the Experience Design project funded by the Research Council of Finland, expected in 2025, titled: *SpaceTimeCraft: Integrative Research through Design into the Experience of Virtual Navigation*.
