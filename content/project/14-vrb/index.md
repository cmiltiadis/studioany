*VectorRasterBleep* is an interactive installation developed as a playful interpretation of a baroque garden to the digital-virtual domain. 
The garden is conceived as the Queen's antidote to boredom, a playground open to stimuli for subverting the normality of everyday life, and a gateway to the fantastic and phantasmic. 
Wearing an electronic suit, the Queen escapes to the garden to explore its wonders. 
Its physical dimension is a space --any generic space-- tracked by infrared sensors and populated by machinery. 
Its virtual counterpart, however, is a live phantom that transforms continuously to reflect the Queen's desires while she strolls the generic space.

Technical information: 
- Wearable suit with 20 LEDs, a speaker, and an Arduino microcontroller with an XBEE wireless module
- Kinect motion tracking sensor
- Custom software for motion tracking and interactive graphics generation developed in Java 
- Projector 

Developed in 2014 for a course taught by Mihye An at the Chair for CAAD, ETH Zurich.
