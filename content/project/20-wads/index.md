Co-curation of virtual exhibition at Ars Electronica Festival 2020 *In Kepler's Gardens* (September 9-13, 2020). The exhibition involved 21 artists and consisted of 11 virtual environments developed in Mozilla Hubs. 
## Exhibition text  
WADS (↑ ← → ↓) speaks of plurality and plentifulness, of conjoining principles, disciplines and possibilities. As a virtual space compiled of local artists, it sets out to explore the potential of digital hubs as grounds of artistic and technological co-creation. It imagines a garden of commoning where artists pollinate the digital by employing a technique derived from gardening: namely, grafting.

In this spirit and following its own mission, RISE invites local artists to pollinate the digital by employing a technique derived from gardening: namely, grafting. WADS, a digital garden of commoning formed by 21 local artists, sets out to explore the potential of digital hubs as grounds of artistic and technological co-creation. The digital exhibition is created and experienced in the online environment of Mozilla Hubs and will be accessible through the Ars Electronica Digital Platform.

## Project presentation 

WADS was exhibited at the Thinker Maker Space in Nicosia, on October 15-16, 2020.
