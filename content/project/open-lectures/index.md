The *IAM Open Lecture Series* was founded in late 2015 at the Institute of Architecture and Media (IAM), TU Graz. The project slowly formalised as a mapping of the research ecology concerning computation and related discourse in the wider field of architecture and media. 
The series hosts talks by younger academic researchers and practitioners aiming to present and promote experimental, interdisciplinary and ongoing research. 
All sessions are hosted at the New Media Lab of IAM, Kronesgasse 5/III, Graz. 

# Open lectures archive

# Credits 
The *IAM Open Lecture* series was founded in late 2015 by Constantinos Miltiadis who curated and produced the first 30 sessions of the series until mid 2019--except lectures \#1 and \#15 organized by Urs Hirschberg, and \#10 organized by Florian Fend.  
Since late 2019, the *Open Lectures Series* is carried out by current members of IAM.
