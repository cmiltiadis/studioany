The *IAM Open Lecture Series* was founded in late 2015 at the Institute of Architecture and Media (IAM), TU Graz. The project slowly formalised as a mapping of the research ecology concerning computation and related discourse in the wider field of architecture and media. 
The series hosted talks by younger academic researchers and practitioners to present and promote experimental, interdisciplinary and ongoing research. 
The Open Lecture Series were hosted at the New Media Lab of IAM, at Kronesgasse 5/III, Graz. 

Video documentation of the IAM Open Lectures sessions is archived at the [TU Graz Tube](https://tube.tugraz.at/paella/ui/browse.html?series=9866b725-a6f2-41ca-8e5c-00879478b22f) and on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/channels/iamlectures).  
See also the [IAM Open Lectures archive](/tag/iam-open-lectures), on this website. 

# Credits 

The series was founded by the former IAM staff Constantinos Miltiadis in late 2015, who curated and produced the series until mid 2019, up to session \#30. 
The *Open Lectures Series* is continued by current members of IAM.
