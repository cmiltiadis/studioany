◯ was an experimental event series and collective based in Graz, active from 2019 to 2022. Founded in early 2019 by a group of eight individuals associated with the computer music program at the Institute of Electronic Music, University of Music and Performing Arts Graz, the collective aimed to curate and produce experimental post-genre events that blended contemporary bass and dance music with experimental electronics, live arts, and discourse.

◯ was launched on May 5, 2019, at Forum Stadtpark. Following that and throughout 2019, the collective was highly active, organizing its own events while also participating in a variety of festivals and events. However, as the pandemic took hold in 2020 and several members relocated from Graz, sustaining the series became increasingly challenging. 
Eventually, ◯  held its closing event at Forum Stadtpark on November 25, 2022.
