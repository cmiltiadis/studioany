The ESUM project was initiated by Dr. Reinard König at the [Chair of Information Architecture](http://www.ia.arch.ethz.ch) ETH Zurich. The idea behind is to create a mobile sensor unit that will measure, analyze and correlate ambient and biometric data from a subject’s itinerary in an urban context, so as to correlate environmental qualities with psychosomatic effects.

The author’s task was to design, develop and document the hardware and software of a stable prototype, to be replicated by research labs around the world.

The software was developed as a Visual Studio C# console application. The ESUM case is made from plywood and partly plexiglas, and can be laser cut and assembled in less than 1 hour. The fabrication plans, software source code and an extended setup and documentation handbook guide will be published soon on public repositories, open to collective further development.

Parts:

- Barebone PC
- Battery unit
- 16 point wireless EEG
- GPS
- WiFi sniffer
- Biometric watch (electrodermal activity, photoplethysmography, peripheral temperature, motion)
- Atmospheric pressure sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Humidity sensor
- O3 sensor
- Air pollutants sensor I (C4H10, CH3CH2OH, H2, CO, CH4)
- Air pollutants sensor II (C6H5CH3, H2S, CH3CH2OH, NH3, H2)
- CO2 sensor
- NO2 sensor
- Sound pressure sensor
- Luminosity sensor
- Dust sensor

Prototype design & development, documentation design.

ESUM is currently a joint research project between The Chair of Information Architecture ETH Zurich and Bauhaus-University of Weimar, with ties to other interdisciplinary research groups at ETH Zurich and the [Future Cities Lab ETH](http://www.fcl.ethz.ch) in Singapore.
