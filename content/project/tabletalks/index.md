**_Tabletalks on Architecture_** (2016-2017) was an initiative at the Architecture Faculty of TU Graz intended for cultivating a research community by sharing the work of young researchers. The series was conceived as a casual event outside of formal structures, as a space where academics, students, and practicing architects can converge, engage, exchange, and discuss matters related to architecture and architectural research.

The event is free, open and public.
