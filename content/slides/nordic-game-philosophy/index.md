Videogames have blessed us with novel forms of storytelling and character representation --  matters that were discussed in length in the context of game studies. 

Here, I am concerned with a persistent and sizeable part of videogames that offer neither stories, nor player-character representations per se. Just action journeys. 
This is central to the gaming experience they evoke and thus central to their aesthetic qualities and aesthetic language. 

The problem with this category of games, is that they often evade analytical lenses due to difficulties of accounting for nothing but moment-to-moment action in virtual space.

#### 1. Enactivism {#p1}

<small>
<li class = "fragment"> cognition arises from the dynamic interrelations between an active organism and its surrounding environment </li>
<li class = "fragment"> cognition is an exercise of skilful know-how in situated and embodied action, modulated through sensorimotor couplings</li>


<li class = "fragment"> During gameplay: Player > interactive avatar (technological intentionality) situated in a virtual environment </li>

- Cognitive sciences; by Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch in The Embodied Mind (1991). 
- Builds on phenomenology to suggest ... 
- [not only that perception occurs through the body, but cognition also] 
- Cognition is in the bidirectional relationship between the two   
- Moreover, Enactivism suggest a first-person perspective to the study of experience 
- And it's skillful / thus it can be 
- In games, a Player assumes a technological intentionality through an (interactive) avatar situated in a virtual environment / offset our sensorimotor capacities to those of the avatar / transfer our skills

- no explanation of the world, only by similitude
- here is a joystick, a screen with speakers, go.  
- Slowly as a player you understand how it jumps (or you jump), runs, etc.,  you develop a feeling for it
- Eventually, the whole objective of Mario, is get to the right-most position, by jumping and running

#### But wait... What about saving Princes Peach?

Do we *really* care about Princes Peach?  
Or, is it just an inevitability of the game's representational narrative layer?

{{<speaker_note>}}

- saving Princess Peach is not the goal. It's an inevitability of the game's representational narrative framing. Not causal. 
- Nevertheless, it cannot explain the experience of the game / it's rather an overlay on top

> Video games are a window onto a new kind of intimacy with machines [...] The holding power of video games, their almost hypnotic fascination, is computer holding power. The experiences of video game players help us to understand this holding power and something else as well. At the heart of the computer culture is the idea of constructed, “rulegoverned” worlds.

{{< fragment >}}
> There is nothing mindless about mastering a video game.... It’s more than thinking—in a way it is beyond thinking. The hand learns what to do and does it automatically, just as the hand “knows” after playing chord X on the piano to go directly and inexorably to chord Y.

#### 2. The problem with analysis {#p2}


> The Study of Games demonstrates that the narrow history of game research has mostly been sociological, anthropological, or philosophical, but not very well developed as an aesthetic field. That is, while much space has been devoted to the study of people (other than the researcher) playing games, **very little has been said about the first-person experience of playing a game**.

{{</speaker_note>}}

> Game studies methodologies which focus on the visual, narrative, and semiotic content of digital games overlook the way that embodied perception and physiological response contribute to the meaningfulness of games. Gameplay also needs to be understood in terms of affective response: the embodied, multisensory perception of the game environment.

- Much of it has to do with the existing structures of scholarship -- and especially the textual medium, which has significant shortcomings in aspects of games research  
- we are all guilty of trying to make sense of rich audio-visual, procedural, interactive, and performative media (like videogames) in the most conventional and traditional of means. Simple text.

#### Spatial turn in computer game studies?

> [Spatial simulation] is also a way to explore the partly unknown, to test models and hypotheses, and thus to construct and acquire new knowledge in a way narrative never could.  
> ... games celebrate and explore spatial representation as their central motif and raison d’être. (Aarseth 2000)

{{<fragment>}}

> The mediality of games can be derived from spatial configurations in the first instance, defining not only the edges of any possible game (as well as the act of gaming) but also transgressing what has, until now, been the border of game studies by overcoming the gap between narratological and ludological approaches. Thus, within the last few years, there has been a paradigmatic shift within computer games studies, which allows a focus on the games in their limits as interactive media. (Gunzel 2008)

{{</fragment>}}

{{<fragment>}}

> But we could also attempt to understand computer games as exemplifications of spatial concepts...
> Philosophical concepts of space, then, are not about a "true" or "false" representation of nature, but rather, they are the expression of culture. 
> Again, this is not a claim that the four-dimesional concept of space is "true," it only states that computer games can exemplify philosophical concepts--perhaps more accurately than any medium.

- gave us multiple phenomena such as modding; mapping; speedrunning
- comes to a halt at about the 2000s / With the rise of consoles that essentially slowed down FPS because of their gamepad interface

- Design as a mode of reasoning for the new - 
- Schmid suggests Generic epistemology as 'a paradigm shift without crisis'- concerned with post-discplinary 'integrative' objects (superimposition of fragments of different disciplines), and contemporary materials, which require active experimentation to investigate their potentials

#### Intensive assemblages 

{{< fragment >}}

> An individual organism will typically exhibit a variety of capabilities to form assemblages with other individuals, organic or inorganic. A good example is the assemblage which **a walking** animal forms with **a piece of solid ground** (which supplies it with a surface to walk) and with **a gravitational field** (which endows it with a given weight). Although the capacity to form an assemblage depends in part on the emergent properties of the interacting individuals (animal, ground, field) it is nevertheless not reducible to them. We may have exhaustive knowledge about an individual’s properties and yet, not having observed it in interaction with other individuals, know nothing about its capacities...  
> An assembly process may be said to be characterized by intensive properties when it articulates heterogeneous elements [...In this example] three heterogeneous individuals are joined together as such without the need for any homogenization.
