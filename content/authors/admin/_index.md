Constantinos Miltiadis (b. 1986) is a transdisciplinary architect and researcher; also programmer, curator, media artist, teacher, archivist, and librarian.
He is currently pursuing a doctoral dissertation titled *SpaceTimeCraft* (expected in 2025), at the [School of Arts, Design & Architecture at Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/school-of-arts-design-and-architecture). 

<!-- EDUCATION & EXPERIENCE -->
Constantinos studied architecture at [NTU-Athens](https://www.arch.ntua.gr/?lang=en) (Dipl-.Ing Architect Engineer), and at the [Chair for CAAD/Digital Architectonics](https://www.caad.arch.ethz.ch/) ETH Zurich (MAS in Architecture and Information), with additional studies in computer music at [IEM KU Graz](https://iem.kug.ac.at/en/). 
Between 2015 and 2019 he was assistant professor at the [Institute of Architecture and Media](https://iam.tugraz.at/main-website/en/) at TU Graz. 
Since late 2019 he is a doctoral researcher at the Dept. of Design & Dept. of Architecture at [Aalto University, School of ARTS](https://www.aalto.fi/en/school-of-arts-design-and-architecture).  

<!-- INTERESTS // g](../category/prototype)-->
Constantino's main research interests concern aesthetic phenomena between technology and culture, which he pursues through various methods including computational design research, speculative prototyping, experimental gamemaking, teaching, artistic research, and curatorial work.
Since the mid-2010s his research focus concerns [virtual architecture](../../project/spacetimecraft), implementing integrative design research to investigate the aesthetic dimension of spatiotemporal environments that are *inconstructible* in the physical world, and thus specific to and experienceable through digital media such as VR and videogames. 

<!-- WORK -->
Constantino's research has been [presented](../event/) in seminars, conferences and exhibitions, and [published](../publication/) in academic fields including architecture, artistic research, and game studies. 
He has [developed and taught original course curricula](../course) on creative computation, and experimental game design and VR development in both academic and extra-academic contexts.
Moreover, he has been involved in multiple projects and transdisciplinary [collaborations](../tag/collaboration), including [curatorial projects](../category/curatorial), [discursive and artistic event production](../../curation), [exhibitions](../tag/exhibition), and [installations](../tag/installation).

<!-- GROUPS -->
He is part of the working groups [ENCORE](https://www.aalto.fi/fi/muotoilun-laitos/encore-engaging-co-design-research-group) and [Game Design Praxiology](https://aakoosgamelab.com/gamepraxi/) at Aalto ARTS, the cross-continental Games & Praxis group, the special interest group [Spatial Aesthetics and Artificial Environments](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1108448/1108449), and the Helsinki-based collective [Station of Commons](../project/station-of-commons).
