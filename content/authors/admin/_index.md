Constantinos Miltiadis is a transdisciplinary architect, programmer and digital design researcher. 
His work explores new aesthetic and experiential forms at the intersection of design, spatial interaction, and immersive technologies. 
He has worked across scientific research, design consulting, UX, R&D, and creative technology prototyping, with a focus on interactive media, exploratory gamemaking, and VR development. 

He is currently a design researcher at [Aalto University, School of Arts, Design & Architecture ](https://www.aalto.fi/en/school-of-arts-design-and-architecture), part of the Experience Design project funded by the Research Council of Finland, where he is pursuing a Doctorate in Arts with a dissertation titled *SpaceTimeCraft*, expected in 2025.

<!-- EDUCATION & EXPERIENCE -->
Previous roles include assistant professor at the [Institute of Architecture and Media](https://iam.tugraz.at/main-website/en/), TU Graz (2015-2019), research assistant at ETH Zurich (2014-2015), and digital design consultant (2012-2015).
Constantinos studied architecture at [NTU-Athens](https://www.arch.ntua.gr/?lang=en) (Dipl-.Ing Architect Engineer 2012), and at the [Chair for CAAD/Digital Architectonics](https://www.caad.arch.ethz.ch/) ETH Zurich (MAS in Architecture and Information 2014), and pursued further studies in computer music at [IEM KU Graz](https://iem.kug.ac.at/en/) (2018-2019). 

<!-- WORK -->
His research has been [presented](../event/) at international conferences and seminars, [published](../publication/) in academic fields including architecture, artistic research, and game studies, and featured in international media outlets. 
He has developed and taught [original courses](../course) on creative programming, experimental game design and VR development in both academic and extra-academic settings.
He is also active through transdisciplinary [collaborations](../tag/collaboration), [curatorial works](../category/curatorial), [discursive and artistic event production](../curation), [exhibitions](../tag/exhibition), and [installations](../tag/installation).

<!-- INTERESTS // g](../category/prototype)-->
<!-- 
Constantino's main research interests concern aesthetic phenomena between technology and culture, which he pursues through various methods including computational design research, speculative prototyping, experimental gamemaking, teaching, artistic research, and curatorial work.
Since the mid-2010s his research focus concerns [virtual architecture](../project/spacetimecraft), implementing integrative design research to investigate the aesthetic dimension of spatiotemporal environments that are *inconstructible* in the physical world, and thus specific to and experienceable through digital media such as VR and videogames.
