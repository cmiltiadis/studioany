abstract: 'Virtual reality opens a new world of a great potential for both research and
experimentation by allowing new forms of unbuilt sensible architectural space.
The paper starts with a sketch of the current context in Virtual Reality and
continues by outlining the development and structure of the research "project
Anywhere". The project is an easily deployable, wireless, multi-user, augmented
reality app-system that offers full body immersion through body, head and hands
tracking. It can host multiple concurrent users, able to move freely in the virtual
space, by moving in the real, and also perform actions through a gesture interface
to affect their shared environment. Concluding, we describe the inherent
properties of such a space, which we propose as a novel spatial medium for
architecture, through an example of a potential application.'
