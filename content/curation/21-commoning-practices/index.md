# Exhibition outline

The exhibition "Digital Commoning Practices" departs from Station of Commons; a practice of re-appropriation of technology as Commons within public space, which stands for radical alternative strategies to the neo-liberal system in terms of **digital means of production, communication and distribution**. "Digital Commoning Practices" starts with a question: How to think of a collaborative process embedded in technology that can find form into new knowledge and know-hows within, against and beyond capitalist modes of production?

"Digital commoning practices" intends to both elaborate a critical discourse on the economization process, and to reflect on digital tools development to resist, and rebel, against privatization of technological means. Activist and architect Stavros Stavrides insists that commoning practices must welcome a multitude of knowledges, discourses, practices and know-hows for the emergence of commoning spaces. The dynamic at work operates as a collective and **transformative effort always in the making**. The exhibition invites artists, activists, urbanists, publishers, designers, programmers, feminists and educators to open, share their work in an Open Source way of doing and thinking.

## An exhibition as timelime

**The exhibition process produces a month long timelime to articulate** different temporalities; live audio streams, lectures, discussion and workshops.This format imagines an exhbition as an intersection of eventfull temporalities more than a division of space in the traditional white cube practice. "Digital Commoning Practices" timeline develops over three phases.

The exhibition opens with the celebration of the first anniversary of the Open Source audio stream. Together with Helsinki based *N10 collective*, Station of Commons will broadcast 5 sound artists whose work has developed in absence of concert situation.

The second phase aggregates a network of activists, theorists and artists involved in physical and technological spaces. This moment intends to **intersect their knowledges and practice**s to examine and think together commoning practices in the current hybrid spaces. This phase interrogates how digital commoning practices can come to terms with old gender stereotype and how can all technology pirates work together.

The third phase entittled **"Commoning Education/Educating the Commons"** discusses how can digital practices and radical education can learn from each other. Learning together from the practices of the participants we will _deploy an edifice_ to initiate an operative digital commoning practice...

**OFFREAL video installation by Malin Kuht**  
/Ground floor in gallery space.  
Alexander Galloway writes in his book „The Interface Effect”, that „an interface is not a thing, an interface is always an effect. It is always a process or a translation.” This effect includes how humans are affected by an interface and the way they are able to engage with a machine. OFFREAL considers interfaces as conjunctions of possibilities, histories and power relations.  
In OFFREAL, two virtual assistants, called Ashley and Allison, are given the ability to diffract their existence as interface(s) and their looks. In addition to the female-coded voice, many avatars are designed according to pop-cultural ideals of beauty, which raises political and representational questions. The categories race and gender remain contested in the discourse on virtual bodies. What does it mean to be human and to become human in this digital age? Human-ess and Machines meet somewhere OFF the REAL in a speculative space.

# Phase 2: Digital Commoning Practices {#p2}

## First Session: Intersecting Commons

11.03.2021 19h UTC+2  
Activation with **Selena Savic** in discussion with **Station of Commons** Juan Gomez & Gregoire Rousseau.

11.03.2021 20h UTC+2  
**"Rethinking the common: Exploring the potentialities of space commoning"**  
by Stavros Stavrides  
If commoning is about complex and historically specific processes through which representations, practices and values intersect in circumscribing what is to be shared and how in a specific society, where can we locate the potentialities of space commoning? Based on the view that commoning practices are characterized both by the means they employ and by the subjects that participate in them, this presentation will explore how inhabited space may become a shaping factor of solidarity and collaboration relations between commoners.

12.03.2021 19h UTC+2  
**"Unsettling the Universal: Really Useful Commoning"**  
by Dubravka Sekulić  
Feminism, reminds us Lola Olufemi “is a political project of what could be.” Commons can be understood along similar lines. Both have to be understood as verbs, concepts that do, unsettle and transform, ways we are in the world. Thinking at the intersection between digital and urban, in my talk I will propose a reading of the public library as an important node in the feminist and commoning consciousness raising operation.

13.03.2021 19h UTC+2  
**"Variations of Gender and Technology Trouble"**  
by Cornelia Sollfrank  
Technofeminism is based on two basic assumptions: 1) technology is not neutral and 2) technology is a highly gendered field. These presuppositions open up a field of questions, problems and related practices. Based on selected positions in theory and practice, the talk exemplifies some of the tensions and openings from which to rethink ways of encountering the current technopolitical crisis. Commoning here serves as a framework for the process of vision and implementation, of experimentation and evaluation, of responding to the contemporary condition by creating new forms, formats and formations and questioning them again.

## Second Session: Commoning Education/Educating the Commons

18.03.2021 19h UTC+2  
Activation with **Sam Hart** on “Peer-to-peer Public Works”

20h UTC+2  
**“How to infrastructure otherwise”**  
by **Femke Snelting**, **Jara Rocha** & **Martino Morandi**.  
A hands-on conversation on the ongoing techno-political transformations in (remote) learning environments. How to infrastructure otherwise in more just and solidary ways? On de-schooling, interdependent learning and The bundle theory of the student-user. With Martino Morandi, Jara Rocha and Femke Snelting.

19.03.2021 19h UTC+2  
**“Educating the Commons and Commoning Education”**  
by **Gregoire Rousseau** and **Nora Sternfeld** in dialogue.  
All over the world, education – which could be understood as a universal right and public good – is facing processes of economization and privatization. Technology – which could be understood as a common means of production, collaboratively developed – is taken away from the public and put into corporate hands. This conversation investigates the question of shared and common knowledge from the perspectives of an educator and an engineer, respectively.

**Jara Rocha** works through the situated and complex forms of distribution of the technological with a trans*feminist sensibility. With a curious confidence in transtextual logistics and a clear tendency to profanate modes, they tend to be found in tasks of remediation, action-research and in(ter)dependent curatorship. Main areas of study have to do with the semiotic materialities of political urgencies.

**Cornelia Sollfrank**  
Cornelia Sollfrank (PhD) is an artist, researcher and university lecturer, living in Berlin (Germany). Recurring subjects in her artistic and academic work in and about digital cultures are artistic infrastructures, new forms of (political) self-organization, authorship and intellectual property, techno-feminist practice and theory. As a pioneer of Internet art, Cornelia Sollfrank built up a reputation with two central projects: the net.art generator – a web-based art-producing ‘machine,’ and Female Extension – her famous hack of the first competition for Internet art. Her experiments with the basic principles of aesthetic modernism implied conflicts with its institutional and legal framework and led to her academic research. In her PhD “Performing the Paradoxes of Intellectual Property,” Cornelia investigated the increasingly conflicting relationship between art and copyright. This led to her current research project ‘Creating Commons,’ based at the University of the Arts in Zürich. Her most recent artistic work, the performance À la recherche de l’information perdue, is about gender stereotypes in the digital underground with the example of Wikileaks. The artistic research group #purplenoise, founded in 2018, investigates the potential of social media for political manipulation.  
Recent publications include “The beautiful Warriors. Technofeminist Practice in the 21st Century” (minorcompositions.org), “Aesthetics of the Commons” (diaphanes.net) and “Fix My Code” (with Winnie Soon) (eeclectic.de) – all open access. Homepage: artwarez.org
