# SUMMARY
summary: ''
# ABSTRACT 
abstract: 'A lot of images, architectural blogs, Dezeen, ArchDaily, internet, public space, fashion, Tokyo, Vetements, Barad, brand, void, measurement, empty center, data, 10 years of online architectural publishing, 500 000 images, a weather prognosis, a cloud, an architectural mutant, flavors of contemporary architecture, avatars… dive right into it; filter, search, crawl, articulate. Use machine learning. Write a poem, or code a couple of them. Make sense of what is in fashion now. Compose your own “online mask” – play with information.'
