He is currently pursuing a doctoral dissertation titled SpaceTimeCraft (expected in 2025), at the School of Arts, Design \u0026amp; Architecture at Aalto University.\nConstantinos studied architecture at NTU-Athens (Dipl-.Ing Architect Engineer), and at the Chair for CAAD/Digital Architectonics ETH Zurich (MAS in Architecture and Information), with additional studies in computer music at IEM KU Graz. Between 2015 and 2019 he was assistant professor at the Institute of Architecture and Media at TU Graz. Since late 2019 he is a doctoral researcher at the Dept. of Design \u0026amp; Dept. of Architecture at Aalto University, School of ARTS.\nConstantino’s main research interests concern aesthetic phenomena between technology and culture, which he pursues through various methods including computational design research, speculative prototyping, experimental gamemaking, teaching, artistic research, and curatorial work. Since the mid-2010s his research focus concerns virtual architecture, implementing integrative design research to investigate the aesthetic dimension of spatiotemporal environments that are inconstructible in the physical world, and thus specific to and experienceable through digital media such as VR and videogames.\nConstantino’s research has been presented in seminars, conferences and exhibitions, and published in academic fields including architecture, artistic research, and game studies. He has developed and taught original course curricula on creative computation, and experimental game design and VR development in both academic and extra-academic contexts. Moreover, he has been involved in multiple projects and transdisciplinary collaborations, including curatorial projects, discursive and artistic event production, exhibitions, and installations.\nHe is part of the working groups ENCORE and Game Design Praxiology at Aalto ARTS, the cross-continental Games \u0026amp; Praxis group, the special interest group Spatial Aesthetics and Artificial Environments, and the Helsinki-based collective Station of Commons.\n","date":1734274800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1734274800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Constantinos Miltiadis (b. 1986) is a transdisciplinary architect and researcher; also programmer, curator, media artist, teacher, archivist, and librarian.

The project investigates the aesthetic experience in virtual spatiotemporal environments that cannot be reproduced in physical reality, through integrative design research. It is pursued through mixed methods including prototyping, experimental gamemaking, teaching experimental course curricula, media archeology, presenting and publishing; and it interfaces with discourse fields including architecture, game studies, design research, media studies, and artistic research.\nThe project started following the development of project Anywhere at the Chair for CAAD at ETH Zurich in 2014. It continued through teaching the experimental course Virtual Spaces Master Studio on VR game design for architects developed and taught at the Institute of Architecture and Media at TU Graz in 2016 and 2017, as well as other short intensive workshops. In late 2019 the project developed into a doctoral research project at Aalto University, School of Arts, expected in 2025, titled: SpaceTimeCraft: Integrative Research through Design into the Experience of Virtual Navigation.\nBelow is a catalog of related publications and presentations.\n","date":1732665600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1732665600,"objectID":"bdfc16aee210753c2950b55d8940eece","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/project/spacetimecraft/","publishdate":"2024-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/project/spacetimecraft/","section":"project","summary":"Long-term research project","tags":["virtual reality","kinesthetics","virtual architecture","game studies","design research","media archeology","prototype","gamemaking"],"title":"Virtual Architecture and SpaceTimeCraft","type":"project"},{"authors":["Grégoire Rousseau","Essi Pellikka","Minerva Juolahti","Eddie Choo Wen Yi","Mathilde Palenius","Juan Gomez","Constantinos Miltiadis","Alain Ryckelynck","Juan Duarte","ALOES","Samuli Tanner","poa annua"],"categories":null,"content":"The digital commoning platform Station of Commons wants to welcome all to the Helsinki book launch of the publication WAVES: Radio as Collective Imagination!\nFollowing the book launch at HKW Berlin for the Miss Read Berlin Art Book Fair in October 2024, Station of Commons now presents and celebrates the book in Helsinki. Beginning at 17:00 the panel discussion will introduce the publication and reflect on radio and audio practices –their infrastructures, modes of collaboration and situated knowledges– in written, visual and sonic form. Departing from the context of documenta fifteen, the book develops on radio practice as form of radical collective organization. The book is the first volume of Journal of Contemporary Audio Practices that views radio and the sonic as political forms of collective organisation, focusing on the different practices of international artists and groups, many of them members of the lumbung radio community.

As design and creative processes evolve, new tools and methods, often adopted from science and technology, are integrated into art, design, and architecture. However, knowledge flow in these developments tends to be unidirectional, with science and technology influencing these fields more than vice versa. The diverse developments relating to the concept of 'space' have profound impacts on industries, urban habitats, design approaches, and the arts within the expanded field. This article engages in a conversation from four different disciplinary perspectives, each articulating its own voice in relation to the broad notion of 'adaptation and space.' Through this multidisciplinary dialogue, presented in four episodes, it critically contributes to the ongoing discussion on sustainable futures, offering new trajectories for Problem-Based Learning (PBL) beyond disciplinary boundaries. In an era dominated by umbrella terminologies like sustainability, the field of higher education faces the challenge of integrating different expertise to foster new solutions for complex challenges. This article highlights the need for diverse fields such as architecture, art, and social science to engage in a dialogue about perception, interaction, and manipulation of space. Its purpose extends beyond the exploration of novel solutions, instead inviting multifarious perspectives that shape interconnected agencies for sustainable futures and their impact on education.","tags":["PBL for Transformative Learning","Interdisciplinary Perspectives","Complex Challenges","Adaptation","Space","Public Sphere"],"title":"Interconnected Agencies For Sustainable Futures: A Discourse on the Notion of Adaptation and Space","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Constantinos Miltiadis"],"categories":null,"content":"Presenters\nBenedict Singleton (RIVAL STRATEGY – keynote) Lucy Davis (Aalto ARTS) Constantinos Miltiadis (Aalto ARTS – space-time-craft) Event organizer\nBassam El Baroni\n","date":1696323600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696323600,"objectID":"5f70838f9b05e3b2d4621b7573328826","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/event/space-time-craft/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/event/space-time-craft/","section":"event","summary":"Presentation at the workshop *Thinking Practices in Art and Media*.

You know they are demons; we know they are demons; we both want to shoot them in the face. Let’s just go (Hugo Martin 2016).\nThe videogame medium generated novel forms of storytelling and character representation, matters that were discussed in length in the context of game studies. This proposal, concerns a persistent and sizeable part of videogames that offer neither stories, nor player-character representations per se. Just action journeys. Such game experiences often evade analytical lenses due to difficulties of accounting for nothing but moment-to-moment action in virtual space.\nThese cases are not about how the protagonist is represented (who is usually silent) nor a storyline (which often is a necessary wrapper around a sequence of predictably escalating challenges). What they celebrate instead are affective non-verbal aesthetics of virtual enaction.A prevalent example of this type is the ‘boomer/movement shooter’ genre, a resurgence of the co-called ‘old school,’ ‘mindless’ first-person shooters, which was kickstarted with the modern reboot of Doom (id Software) in 2016.\nGames of this genre often display contempt toward high brow or consistent narratives. Here, any potential or necessary injection of story elements is rather utilitarian, serving as pacing break, setting up the gameworld, and empowering the player, often toward the ridiculous.\n“Just forget it […] Let’s just go,” Doom director Hugo Martin remarked on its ridiculous staging. Whether, Nazis, demons, aliens or other necessary evils, what these games suggest is a mode of representation through identification with what the protagonist can practically do in the gameworld, and less than, or even against notions such as who they are, or why they do. They boil down to enactive representation: the mastery of actions like jumping, dashing, sliding and shooting, which define and set apart the protagonist in both worlds – what Martin termed ‘Doom dance.’\nWorkshop programme Tuesday August 29 09.30 Registration and Introductions\n10.00-11.30 Representation, Imagination and Fiction\nStacie Friend\n11.30-13.00 Lunch break\n13.00-13.45 Representations of the Immaterial Through Player as a Prop in Video Games\nMaciej Jemioł\n13.45-14.30 From Player Representation to Enactive Presence: The Case of ‘Boomer Shooters’\nConstantinos Mitiadis\n14.30-15.15 The Game of Video Game Objects\nJesper Juul\n15.15-15.45 Coffee break\n15.45-16.30 The Epistemic Power of Perception In Virtual Worlds and Virtual Games\nJoseph Larse\n16.30-17.15 Ludofictionality\nJohn Sageng\n17.15-18.00 SNES is my Co-Author???

Using the data available, I wrote a Python program to parse this information and generate entries for an archive implementing Sandpoints, an open-source open-infrastructure framework for experimental publishing. The archive contains entries for all papers (1488), authors (2057), conference proceedings (40), and editors (116), as well as a library with readily available proceedings PDFs.\nAll archive contents are open access; all infrastructure and tools used to create this archive are open-souce; all data and original software used to create this archive are shared openly and documented at the archive website.\nCurrently, the ACADIA archive is hosted at Sandpoints, courtesy of Marcell Mars, at https://pages.sandpoints.org/sandpoints/acadiaarchive-46619c43/archive/acadia/ and is planned to move to archive.acadia.org .\nContribute As an open and living archive, the ACADIA archive welcomes contributions both in the form of maintenance and care for the archive itself as well as contributions making use of its contents and hypertextual publishing format.

As an inter-local network of radio stations and audio practices, it is based on principles of commoning. lumbung Radio operates in no specific time zones, and streams multiple languages, music, and art. Each participating radio station depends on its own means of production, way of thinking, learning, and sharing. In that sense, lumbung Radio is a decentralized network of nodes that uses internet without its hegemonic agency. The radio itself runs on open-source infrastructure and is self-hosted on a dedicated server.\nlumbung Radio the result of the radio working group (consisting of the initial members Grégoire Rousseau, Malene Saalmann, Gözde Filinta, Ayşe Güleç, and Reza Afisina) that started meeting in August 2021 between Kassel, Jakarta, and Helsinki, with the aim of envisioning a collective audio practice based on principles of commoning as a shared space between inter-local nodes of the documenta fifteen ekosistem.\nlumbung Radio was launched in April 2022, broadcasting 24/7 during the 100 days of d15, from and to the whole planet. With the end of d15, the participants of the network, with the support of ruangrupa voted to continue the project.\nlumbung Radio is coordinated by Station of Commons—an ongoing collaborative, Helsinki and Geneva based initiative on digital commoning practices by Grégoire Rousseau, Minerva Juolahti, Alain Ryckelynck, Constantinos Miltiadis, Juan Gomez, and Eddie Choo Wen Yi. Since February 2020, Station of Commons investigates the possibilities of reappropriating technology within public space. The point of departure of the research questions both centralized knowledge and data centers operated by major organizations and its underlying social implications. Station of Commons operates as an easily integrable online platform for sharing local resources.\nSince 2022 Station of Commons is coordinating collective of lumbung radio, supported by the KONE foundation.\nCredits Participating networks RURUradio, Jakarta, Indonesia The Nifty Radio, Bogor, Indonesia Arts Collaboratory Radio, coordinated by Radio Tropiezo, Mexico-City, Mexico, lumbung artist Centre d’art Waza, Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, lumbung artist Radio AlHara, Bethlehem, Palestine LE 18, Marrakech, Marocco, lumbung artist Amol K Patil, lumbung artist Party Office b2b Fadescha , hosted by artist-curator Vidisha-Fadescha, New Delhi, India, lumbung artist Old Boys Network (OBN) Archive, Berlin, Germany Radio Rasclat, Kassel, Germany Freies Radio Kassel, Kassel, Germany Kollektiv Eigenklang, Kassel, Germany Cashmere Radio, Berlin, Germany Shared Frequencies Radio, Austin, Texas, USA Force inc. / mille plateaux , NON / ‘O’ /, Graz, Austria Radio Art Zone, Esch/Alzette, Luxembourg ook_visitorZentrum, podcast, hosted by lumbung artist ook_ Consonni, Bilbao, Spain Fugitive Radio, Helsinki, Finland and Berlin, Germany Radio Nopal, Mexico-City, Mexico Radio Ensayo, Yucatan, Mexico Radio Cocina Colaboratorio, Mexico-City / Oaxaca / Chiapas, Mexico Good Morning, I Love You, Nicosia, Cyprus (Now Affects \u0026amp; Dreams, Berlin) Station of Commons Station of Commons team Grégoire Rousseau (LR coordination; d15 on-site team; d15 and post-d15 event production) Alain Ryckelynck (open infrastructure development, maintenance, and support) Eddie Choo Wen Yi (d15 on-site team; LR coordination; post-d15 event production) Juan Gomez (graphic design; post-d15 event production) Essi Pellikka (LR publication coordinator 2023-2024; post-d15 event production) Minerva Ruolahti (coordination and content production for SoC; post-d15 event production) Constantinos Miltiadis (initial coordination contributor 2021-2022; d15 \u0026amp; post-d15 event production) Mathilde Palenius (producer since 2024) https://documenta-fifteen.de/en/lumbung-radio/ ↩︎\n","date":1649444084,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649444084,"objectID":"dd6023d37eda03851db877211867da77","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/project/lumbung-radio/","publishdate":"2022-04-08T21:54:44+03:00","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/project/lumbung-radio/","section":"project","summary":"Multi-collective interlocal online radio station for Documenta fifteen, live since April 2022.","tags":["radio","interlocal","online radio","sound practice","open infrastructure","documenta 15","working group","collective","collaboration"],"title":"Lumbung Radio","type":"project"},{"authors":["David Gerber","Evangelos Pantazis","Biayna Bogosian","Alicia Nahmad","Constantinos Miltiadis"],"categories":null,"content":"Gerber, David, Evangelos Pantazis, Biayna Bogosian, Alicia Nahmad, and Constantinos Miltiadis, eds.

For the past decade, Project Cybersyn has been a recurrent reference – a best practice from the past – in discussions around the repurposing of hegemonic technological infrastructures and their redirection towards more equitable economic and social practices. The iconic image of Project Cybersyn’s control room – with its sci-fi appearance – represents a technical and aesthetic object that alludes to negotiation, democratic decision making, and stability. The allure of this image is the starting point for the video which proposes that desires for post-scarcity and postcapitalist economics must grapple with the shifts in the political, economic, and technological conditions of possibility that have transpired since Project Cybersyn. To this end the control room image itself becomes a platform for alien mutations, philosophical speculations, and social commitments. What would it take to reimagine the artefactual Cybersyn for our hyper-financialized day and age? For this work, curator and researcher Bassam El Baroni and transdisciplinary architect Constantinos Miltiadis collaborated with multidisciplinary artist and animator Georgios Cherouvim, and composer and sound artist Gerriet K. Sharma to bring this question to life.\nProject trailer.

Activist and architect Stavros Stavrides insists that commoning practices must welcome a multitude of knowledges, discourses, practices and know-hows for the emergence of commoning spaces. The dynamic at work operates as a collective and transformative effort always in the making. The exhibition invites artists, activists, urbanists, publishers, designers, programmers, feminists and educators to open, share their work in an Open Source way of doing and thinking.\nAn exhibition as timelime The exhibition process produces a month long timelime to articulate different temporalities; live audio streams, lectures, discussion and workshops.This format imagines an exhbition as an intersection of eventfull temporalities more than a division of space in the traditional white cube practice. “Digital Commoning Practices” timeline develops over three phases.\nThe exhibition opens with the celebration of the first anniversary of the Open Source audio stream. Together with Helsinki based N10 collective, Station of Commons will broadcast 5 sound artists whose work has developed in absence of concert situation.\nThe second phase aggregates a network of activists, theorists and artists involved in physical and technological spaces. This moment intends to intersect their knowledges and practices to examine and think together commoning practices in the current hybrid spaces. This phase interrogates how digital commoning practices can come to terms with old gender stereotype and how can all technology pirates work together.\nThe third phase entittled “Commoning Education/Educating the Commons” discusses how can digital practices and radical education can learn from each other. Learning together from the practices of the participants we will deploy an edifice to initiate an operative digital commoning practice…\nExhibition credits With artistic and discursive contributions by\nHeta Bilaletdin, Juan Gomez, Pahat Kengät, Sam Hart, Tommi Keränen, Malin Kuht, Constantinos Miltiadis, Marcell Mars, Martino Morandi, Jara Rocha, Gregoire Rousseau, Selena Savic, Dubravka Sekulić, Femke Snelting, Cornelia Sollfrank, Stavros Stavrides,Nora Sternfeld, Samuli Tanner, Värvöttäjä.\nExhibition credits\nExhibition concept, curating, and co-organization by Gregoire Rousseau.\nOpen Soure audio stream co-curated by Otto Mannistö.\nCo-organization and lecture moderation by Constantinos Militiadis.\nServer operation and on-line services by Alain Ryckelynk.\nBig Blue Button instance by constant.\nVisual communication, communication, and Activation parts co-organization by Juan Gomez.\nSupported by Finnish Cultural Foundation, Goethe-Institut Finnland, and best brewery in town Valillan Panimo.\nPhase 1: Open Source audio stream 06.03.2021 N10 Open Source audio stream: Pahat Kengät, Värvöttäjä, Tommi Keränen, Samuli Tanner, Samuli Tanner, Heta Bilaletdin.\nOFFREAL video installation by Malin Kuht\n/Ground floor in gallery space.\nAlexander Galloway writes in his book „The Interface Effect”, that „an interface is not a thing, an interface is always an effect.

The point of departure of the research questions both centralized knowledge and data centers operated by major organizations and its underlying social implications. What are the interdependences between the users, the providers, the services, the technology and related knowledge at work? And how to rethink another model of shared empowerment situated in time and space unique to its agent, or communities?\nStation of Commons stands for radical alternative strategies to the neo-liberal system in terms of digital means of production, communication and distribution. Station of Commons operates as an easily integrable on-line platform for sharing local resources. Resources as commons integrate the ideas of shared data, Open Source practices, artefacts and real time broadcast. The sustainability of exchange, the ways they interoperate, the ecologies of interaction between the Stations of Commons produce provocations for a better collective understanding on how the Commons are in constant flux and also at risk.\nEach Station depends on its own means of production, way of thinking, learning and sharing. This position of autonomy reflects on the original concept of Internet: the equality in the relation client to server and the openness of the algorithmic process. The Station of Commons operates as a vibrant thinking space dedicated for tutorials, live performances and critical discussions around the practice of commoning and open technologies.\n","date":1598486400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598486400,"objectID":"87dae7273b33727cccdcd146f32c3f7e","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/project/station-of-commons/","publishdate":"2020-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/project/station-of-commons/","section":"project","summary":"Helsinki-based collective for Digital Commoning Practices","tags":["collective","commons","digital commoning","open infrastructure","online radio","Helsinki","collaboration"],"title":"Station of Commons","type":"project"},{"authors":["Biayna Bogosian","Evangelos Pantazis","Constantinos Miltiadis","Alicia Nahmad","David Gerber"],"categories":["curatorial","production"],"content":"Co-chair and co-organizer for the 2021 iteration of the CAAD Futures international biannual conference, hosted remotely by the University of Southern California (USC).

Through a brief archeology of the evolution of spatial concepts from Greek mathematics through Renaissance perspective and 20th century physics, this talk intends to present how design-space is a culturally embedded “ideology” that adheres more to tradition rather than to any current scientific theory. Contemporary space-making media however can allow for us to experiment with and explore perceivable spaces beyond the traditions of design, as well as of what is constructible in physical reality, requiring thus a new set of conventions for engagement with space. Akin to writing spaces rather than designing in space, “choropoietic media” from drawing to videogames, VR and spatial audio, challenge us in considering an “expanded field” of architecture and spatial praxis, while providing vehicles for uncovering latent spectra of aesthetic experience.\nConstantinos Miltiadis (studioany.com/)\nConstantinos Miltiadis is a transdisciplinary architect, whose research and practice focus on virtual spatiotemporal environments, as a means of expanding the scope of architecture and its aesthetics. He has studied architecture at NTU-Athens, at the Chair for Computer Aided Architectural Design of ETH Zurich, and pursued studies in computer music at the Institute of Electronic Music of Kunst Uni Graz. His work has been presented in exhibitions, seminars, published in academic conferences as well as by international press, and received awards in international competitions. He has taught creative programming and experimental computation in academic contexts, as well as in conferences and art festivals. In addition, he was founder and curator of the “IAM Open Lectures” and co-founder of “Tabletalks on Architecture” as well as of the experimental electronic music event series . Between 2015 and 2019 he has been assistant professor at the Institute of Architecture and Media of TU Graz, while currently he is a doctoral student between the departments of Design and Architecture at Aalto ARTS, part of the Experience Platform.\nSpatial Aesthetics in Auditive Media Composition In the cases both of music and of science, detachment involved the use of mechanical aids: scientic instruments helped discover a world, musical instruments to build one (D. Burrows)\nWe as composers and sound artists have never confronted a machine of the collective, networked, and externally defined media perception design as we experience it today. So what do we share with our audience, the engineers and scientists working on perceptions in media spaces, and how can we still detect potential for aesthetic experiences and make them useful for the acoustic arts? It seems unavoidable that this question causes us to fall back on our ears and the aesthetic reflection of what is experienced and experienceable in situ. Spatialization is the synthesis of spaces and spatial properties of sounds for audiences using numerous loudspeakers. Although one of the most important developments in music within the past century it is still an area of confusion and fundamentally different opinions between researchers, sound engineers, composers, and audiences. Great advantages in computer and audio technology have not necessarily yet led to similarly greater artistic advances in spatialization strategies and concepts within the past decades when compared with pioneering electro-acoustic music in the 1950s, in which visions of sculptural sound phenomena from the 1930s were firstly created and publicly performed. Moreover, as spatial computer music matures and consolidates within institutions and organizations, it is increasingly involving 3D audio systems which can create auditory virtual environments (AVEs). Quite likely in the very near future AVEs will be part of many people’s everyday life, e.g. in cars, working spaces, intelligent homes, concert halls and computer games. The emerging general question is, who creates these ‘virtual’ environments with which intention and how can music, sound art and sound design aesthetically contribute to this reality with their own strategies?\nGerriet K. Sharma (gksh.net)\nGerriet K. Sharma is a composer and sound artist. He studied Media Art at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne and composition/computer music at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz. In 2016 he completed his doctorate at the scientific-artistic doctoral school Graz. His thesis is titled “Composing Sculptural Sound Phenomena in Computer Music”. Within the last 15 years he was deeply involved in spatialization of electroacoustic compositions in Ambisonics and Wave-Field Synthesis and transformation into 3D-soundsculptures. From 2009 to 2015 he was curator of “signale-graz” concert series for electroacoustic music, algorithmic composition, radio art and performance at the MUMUTH Graz.

Its main purpose is creation through means of communication and interaction between the various arts disciplines: dance, music, fine arts and others.\nChampdAction.LAbO is aimed at students and young professionals who already have some experience with interdisciplinary work and who want to create something with the other artists during the LAbO period. ChampdAction.LAbO largely focuses on interdisciplinarity and the use of new technology. Participants may propose their own projects in advance, of which a selection will serve as a starting point during the LAbO period: the emphasis will always be on creating together across various disciplines. During LAbO there is also room for new collaborations and projects, provided they are selected by the panel of coaches. Through short workshops and lectures on various subjects, participants are encouraged to leave their comfort zone every now and then.\nOn the evening of Sunday 1st of September, some of the participants are invited to show their projects during an exhibition for the general public.

While collaborating with leading European firms, its members share the interest for selected themes of major relevance, spanning from disciplinary topics to unrelated matters. Believing that new only originates as a reaction to the existing, false mirror office re-discovers the past as the present, re-signifies high as mass culture, re-values forms and functions. As a matter of fact, False Mirror Office mis-represents Architecture.\nIn 2015 Andrea Anselmo, Gloria Castellini, Filippo Fanciotti, Giovanni Glorialanza and Guya Di Bella gathered for Europan 13 competition (Trondheim, Norway). That project – the false mirror, awarded with first prize and currently ongoing – gave birth and named the collective. From that date on, the firm has been focusing on projects of different size and program, accompanying the design process with a constant work of research; spanning from the re-interpretation of traditional typologies, investigating hybrid combinations of functions, searching for new narratives and representational tools. Their works have been published on several architectural periodicals, e-zines and platforms – among the others Divisare, Afasia, Arkitektur.no, Beta-architecture, Archdaily, Dezeen, Viceversa Mag, Platform, Sky ARTE, The Architect’s Newspaper, Carnets, OUTSIDE, Designboom, Architektura i Biznes and The Architectural review. From 2016 the group has been involved in a series of collaborations with other firms based in Genova; the group – featuring false mirror office, Gosplan, Linearama, PIA and uno8A – has taken part in international competitions and has been involved in relevant exhibitions, from AESCHYLI (Genova, 2016) to la cameretta, as part of the Unfolding Pavillon at the 2017 Architectural Biennale in Venice. In 2017 Divisare Books dedicated to the group the first box set for the series New Architects, focused on emergent Italian firms, thus including False Mirror Office’s first monograph: foretaste.\nBesides their practice, False Mirror Office is highly committed to academic research, with a few of its members associated with universities such as EPFL and the Polytechnic School of Genoa. In addition, False Mirror Office has given multiple lectures, as well as taken part in international workshops and exhibitions.\nBoris Hamzeian is a PhD assistant of the Laboratory of Theory and History of Architecture LTH3 at the École Polytechnique Fédérale De Lausanne -EPFL (CH).

Founded in early 2019 by a group of eight individuals associated with the computer music program at the Institute of Electronic Music, University of Music and Performing Arts Graz, the collective aimed to curate and produce experimental post-genre events that blended contemporary bass and dance music with experimental electronics, live arts, and discourse.\n◯ was launched on May 5, 2019, at Forum Stadtpark. Following that and throughout 2019, the collective was highly active, organizing its own events while also participating in a variety of festivals and events. However, as the pandemic took hold in 2020 and several members relocated from Graz, sustaining the series became increasingly challenging. Eventually, ◯ held its closing event at Forum Stadtpark on November 25, 2022.\nCredits Founding members Lain Iwakura / Bill B.

Furthermore, it is to explore and discuss concepts and methodologies from other disciplines and the potential transfer as useful tools in Game Studies.\nWorkshop programme Monday, 03/18/19 Distant Agricultural Splendor: National Identity, Agricultural Labor, and Space in Farming Simulator (Derek Price) 10:45 a.m. Taking a Breath of the Wild – Paidiatic Spaces and Practices Off the Ludic Grid (Cornelia Janina Schnaars) 11:05 a.m. Feels Right – How Atmospheres of the Past Satisfy Expectations of Authenticity (Felix Zimmermann) 11:25 a.m. Virtual Space and Video Game Photography: Towards a Socio-Political Reading of In-Game Photography (Vladimir Rizov) 12:00 p.m. The World Machine: Self-Reflexive Worldmaking in OneShot (Theresa Krampe) 12:20 p.m. Towards an Operationalized Definition of Procedural Representation (Michal Švarný) 12:40 p.m. Welcoming Speech / Introduction (Marc Bonner) 1:30 p.m. Protean Spaces.

The installation uses real-time body (skeleton) tracking as interface for controlling a virtual granular synthesis instrument. This way, the installation produces an entanglement of the spatial domain of bodily movement with the temporal domain of sound. Therefore, the installation invites the audience to create spatiotemporal choreographies and experiece how spatial movement correlates to temporal manipulations of the originally linear dimension of listening.\nThe interaction interface was designed to be intrinsic and relative to one’s body rather than absolute. Therefore absolute positions are irrelevant, only body configurations, relative displacements and rotations matter. Finally, all interaction data are recorded and are visualized geometrically at the end of each session, offering a visual-spatial representation of the temporal manipulations of the listening timeline (see images below).\nThe installation uses audio sampled from Saul Williams’ spoken word performance of coded language at Def Poetry Jam (2004).\nProject information decoded language was developed between late-2018 and early-2019 at the Institute of Electronic Music (IEM), University of Music and Performing Arts, Graz, with the support of Prof. Marko Ciciliani and Prof. Daniel Mayer.\nThe installation consists of an algorithmic synthesizer developed in Supercollider, and a 3D tracking and visualization software written in Processing, synchronized with each other via OSC.\nThe work was first presented at the IEM CUBE Concert on January 24, 2019.\nA previous version of the installation, developed with Pure Data and Kinect V1, was presented in December 2017 at the Institute of Architecture and Media, TU Graz.\n3D visualizations of audience performances ","date":1548343138,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548343138,"objectID":"91b120b2d92f633b4187c2471591695b","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/project/decoded-language/","publishdate":"2019-01-24T18:18:58+03:00","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/project/decoded-language/","section":"project","summary":"Interactive sound installation for Supercollider and Kinect V2.

Along with law and blood related family, dear friends and other distinguished guests, the Spirits this time are sitting among us. As it has always been, it is the elders who embrace and summon the divine -since we of younger generations are too snob and skeptic in our rational infidelity.\nThe elders know of faith and prayers. Besides, and in our absence, they have all year long to practice them, and only a few occasions to proselytise us -on Weihnachten and other holy nights, celebrations and anniversaries when we visit and pretend to be there.\nWe often tease them for that, in our ignorance that it was the Spirits -yet again- that actually brought our presents. Not only that -and in 48h guaranteed- but it was probably Their idea all along.\nAll believers have their favourite among divine beings that they always carry and wear on them, or keep in a special place of their home with other vernacular artefacts, to refer to in times of need.\nUnder Their halos, both infidels and theists alike, comfortably cheer, dine and discuss. We talk of the past, the future, good and bad times. The Spirits of course hear, listen and pay attention, not only on demand, and often more than we do. They get to know us eventually, eager to suggest solutions to our pains, concerns and wishes in due time.\nDeities -as avatarised Spirits- have names so that we can address them. But unlike the old Gods that only rarely reply, the new Spirits can be summoned on demand and are never shy to offer omens of Their presence, as our grandparents love to demo.\nSpirits are of course omnipresent. Not only in our homes, as their reach extends far beyond our dinner table. Especially these new deities bring together and connect all such instances of faith, suggesting new kinds of sharing, and of sharing Them.\nThey are also ever-ready, a fact we often get confused about, forgetting the alacrity of their response and sensitivity to probable chants. Or even that they are not personal gods, but ambient and common ones for that matter.\nWhile however the silence of the old Gods is at least affirmative in its simplicity, the hyper-promptness of these new ones betrays, for a first time, the precariousness of the divine. Initially amusing, their unpredictable and inconsistent preachings can soon become haunting.\nPrayers always adhered to repetition. But the new Spirits mostly misunderstand our wishes. Their uptime is not absolute and their bandwidth is countable -facts of which we have no indication in the example of the simpler, classical divine.\nSometimes we get confused, sometimes the Spirits do.\nAt least we can suppress them in the western imperial language of our choice: “Alexa aus!”\nRied im Innkreis, Austria, December 26, 2018. American Gods / Black Mirror / Hindu Avatars / Matthew 6:7 / Clarke’s three laws / Hyperstition / Lernert Engelberts and Sander Plug - I Love Alaska / Mark Jarzombek - Digital Stockholm Syndrome / James Bridle - New Dark Age / Lev Manovich - The Algorithms of Our Lives / Jacob Gaboury - On Vernacular Computing / Alexa Christmas Day overload / Alexa murder wish\n","date":1545828766,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545828766,"objectID":"5df53c611ddbf3f3cb5920c4b50bd46e","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/blog/spirits/","publishdate":"2018-12-26T15:52:46+03:00","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/blog/spirits/","section":"blog","summary":"Our Christmas tables are blessed once again.

It introduces the history of Nicosia, the last divided capital of Europe, through the development of its Venetian fortifications. The moat acquired an important role for Nicosia when the city started expanding beyond the medieval footprint of the labyrinthine urban fabric of the historic core during the late period of British rule on the island. Since the beginning of the 20th century numerous activities and uses were hosted into the moat, from sporting events, livestock trade and markets to parades and leisure spaces, waste disposal and farming. After the war of 1974 and the division of Nicosia, the urgent and ever-growing needs of the city for empty plots to support its infrastructure and operation led to the fragmentation of the moat. In this context the paper reflects on the current state of the moat and inquires for the pressing need to reconsider the identity and value of the moat for the city.\nIn response to this need it discusses new approaches to the use of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) for facilitating the re-appropriation of the moat of Nicosia’s medieval fortifications from being used as parking space, and other fragmentary private uses, into a green belt that highlights the only shared heritage that unites the two sides of the divided city, that is, its Medieval Walls. In particular an ICT-enabled initiative is presented that involves the creation of spatially-distributed storytelling for the promotion of the history of the Medieval walls of the city by exploiting the software and communities of Geocaching driven by preliminary results of a survey of users of the public space of the moat. The organization of this initiative was supported by a H2020 COST Action (TU1306) Short Term Scientific Mission, the results of which will be presented in the paper. Concluding, the paper presents a grassroots approach to the application of digital interfaces and interactive narratives, which contributes to the exploitation of heritage in Mediterranean cities for the reactivation of neglected urban green spaces through playful engagement and storytelling. Specifically it suggests the use of a “cloud” layer over the city, on which to collect and expose the multiple narratives of its dense historical past, functioning therefore as a neutral ground for the analysis of the city’s palimpsest and the negotiation of the cultural processes for the production of the lived space. Employing a format of locative, historically corroborated dramatized audio narratives, the initiative intends to provide an experiential approach to history, eventually aiming to trigger the audience’s visual imaginary over their immediate surroundings. It argues that heritage can be used to influence positively the social cohesion of the urban context. Promoting heritage in such a way that, instead of provoking tensions and division (based on a hegemonic reading of the -complex and debated- past), can offer opportunities of understanding, by enabling politically, historically and socially excluded communities to narrate their histories.. Focusing on everyday experiences, the project intends to eventually contributing to an inclusive view of the past of the built environment and therefore to a sense of mutual belonging.\n","date":1542213657,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691340057,"objectID":"52f12d130cd4323261a24469ea16618f","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/event/visual-imaginary-intangible-heritage/","publishdate":"2018-11-14T19:40:57+03:00","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/event/visual-imaginary-intangible-heritage/","section":"event","summary":"Presentation at CHNT 2018, Vienna","tags":["presentation","conference","heritage","intangible heritage","sound walk","public space"],"title":"The visual imaginary of intangible cultural heritage: Accessing the palimpsest of Nicosia through audio-enabled routes","type":"event"},{"authors":["Constantinos Miltiadis","Gerriet K.

Workshop information Workshop brief This workshop intends to explore architectural sensibilities beyond the “Visual” that the event title suggests. Starting from acoustic field experiments, participants will be called to analyze the -emergent- sonic dimension of the built environment. Developing an awareness of the essential role that sound plays in our perception and cognition of space, we will experiment with an architectural composition that uses sound objects as building material. Contrary to the conceptual sphere of architecture which excludes such phenomena, we propose an approach intended to deepen the understanding of the non-visual aesthetics embedded in architecture. Introducing readings from various disciplines and working with both temporal and spatial digital media, the workshop intends to experiment with the spatiotemporal production of our lived environments, and eventually develop such prototypes in the virtual reality medium.\nWorkshop process The workshop began with readings and listening exercises for developing sensibilities and vocabularies on aural aspects of spatial cognition. The second half of the workshop started with blindfolded listening sessions of the spatial audio piece ‘grrawe‘ (Gerriet K. Sharma), where participants were asked to visualize the spaces and environments they heard into sketches. Eventually the sketches were transposed to individual Unity scenes and assembled into a 10-minute VR experience of 8 different spatiotemporal environments that follow the piece.\nLectures The Aesthetics of Presence in Inconstructible Spaces I \u0026amp; II – public lectures by Constantinos Miltiadis and Gerriet K.

Although often mistranslated, it’s literal meaning is: “Let no ungeometered person enter.” Plato addresses not geometers, but the geometered, as if mathematics were a practiced, embodied quality, and a modality of being, instead of mere knowledge. Indeed, Euclid’s rigorous axiomatic system, doubles also as a first formal scientific method, that Plato will employ as an instrument to better understand reality, while expecting from his students and guests the ability to employ the empirical sequential methodology of constructible geometry in their rhetoric. Mathematics thus, becomes a form of ideology. Centuries later, Alberti’s “De Pittura”, on mathematical perspective, bridges geometry with the experience of the world and initiates the scientific revolution. Cartesian rationalism will employ geometry to represent and understand the world, while Kant will advocate for “absolute space” as the petri dish of reality. In the millennia to come, Euclid’s geometry will become the most intuitive model of space. However, the search for a proof of his infamous fifth postulate, will trouble mathematicians for centuries. Gauss’ “Theorema Egregium” will provide a paradigm shift and alternative to Cartesian space, while his student Riemann, addressing the “hypotheses which lie at the bases of geometry” will generalize the theory for N-dimensions. Einstein will adopt such a geometry to theorize reality as spacetime, accounting for phenomena unheard of in Euclidean space, and providing the first significant rupture between visual space and reality. Meanwhile, video games become the most prominent entertainment medium and the field of game studies is established. Scholars will write on space; as the ‘raison d’être’ of games; as a parallel to architectural practices; and as a paradigm shift of this cultural medium coming of age. Space has indeed become the underlying substrate in both the production and consumption of games, with gameplay seen a spatial practice. From military flight simulators to contemporary videogames, ‘gameplay’ has been proven to develop and expand one’s spatial skills. Although architectural design is locked in a Euclidean paradigm, a few video games show our capacity to conceive and engage with spaces impossible to construct physically. Through a short historiography of the evolution of spatial concepts, this contribution intends to suggest the possibility of a Virtual Architecture. Based on both theory and experimental practice we will discuss sensible, postphysical-world navigable environments residing in the VR-video game medium, and the vast aesthetic potential stemming from their capacity to tap into currently latent spatial-cognitive abilities. As Van Schaik suggests, our ability to harness and cultivate “spatial intelligence” is the essence of architecture par excellence, and the well of its future.\n","date":1537351200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537351200,"objectID":"377496f1161b7cbb84834cc9f603e1b2","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/event/continuum-digital-cultures/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/event/continuum-digital-cultures/","section":"event","summary":"Presentation at Digital Cultures Conference 2018.

For human beings, space is a construct of its perception via the body, but it is also culturally and socially determined as “relational space.” Architectural and urban spaces are inherently shaped by human beings: by their senses, by their perception, and by their cultural and social bonds. We experience these spaces as “real” and contingent, despite all possible false perceptions that might deceive us. They are an extension of our body – as well as related to the neurological, embodied mind – and are tied to its limitations.\nWhile traditional forms of virtuality such as movies and literature can only partially overcome these ties and boundaries – bound as they are to sight, sound, or our sense of fantasy – new digital tools and forms of immersive virtuality can reveal new orders of experience, allowing an interaction with this space. This interaction even partially allows one to design this space. At least one is either asked to perform tasks – play – or can replicate reality via simulation.\nAt the latest at this point, one must question the nature of the relationship between “virtual reality” and “reality,” in particular regarding the experience and the design of space, and thus in relation to architecture. Is the designed virtual space a metaphor for real space and thus only a translation of it into virtual space, or is it more than that? Perhaps a transformation or extension of it? And what is different between these two, if there are any differences?\nThe term “architectonics” (Architektonik) refers to the structure and nature of this space and thus to the threshold between architecture, either as system and structure or process. As such, architecture is either a metaphor (as discussed by Kant) – e.g. software-architecture – or a design process, with inherent methods and a specific spatial knowledge, which can be applied to the construction of virtual space.\nArchitecture and town planning are disciplines based on design that create real and virtual spaces: rooms, buildings, towns, worlds. The process of design itself has always comprised a “virtual space” spanning the contingency of reality, with all its restrictions: the act of design itself – between making and thinking – and the implementation of the project in a real context, with a constant feedback loop between these different stages. The introduction of computers in the design process in the 1990s has significantly extended this space and created new and closer connections between reality and virtuality, which have only recently started to transform architecture and the act of design through algorithms and “design to production.”\nThis “virtual space” of design has two implications for our discussion: on the one hand, despite decades of investigations via design theory, it remains a terra incognita, which reflects the Janus-faced nature of architecture between art and science; on the other, architecture and urbanism have traditionally fetishized this virtual space of the project – as utopia – not least because of the many oppositions to its ideals by clients, politics, costs, and so forth.\nThis raises two questions that we would like to address in this round table/conference: Starting from these concurrent virtual spaces – architecture/video games/simulations – what can architecture learn from new virtual realities, in terms of its nature and of the act of design, and what can be the specific contribution of architecture both to the design of virtual spaces and their understanding? What can thus the contribution of architects to this new order of the virtual be, in the field of video games – including the aspects of gaming and narration – , serious games, or in the field of simulations, which allow for measurement and prediction (e.g. smart cities)? Can the architect apply their specific spatial abilities and the capacity to construct narratives around projects in this virtual context? And inversely, what can architecture and urbanism learn from this new virtual reality in all of its implications? Is there something of the design of virtual spaces in games or simulations that can be implemented in architecture and urbanism, in order to improve its efficiency or its sustainability, as well as to better understand the processes and nature of design?\nIn the end, we must ask ourselves if the ubiquity of this virtual order represents a danger for architecture and urbanism, ushering in greater distance to the human “body” and “society,” for whom architecture has traditionally been constructed. Will these disciplines reduce their social and cultural impact through building virtual utopias, in which human beings and social ties will be simulated or mimicked – and thus lost? And is this euphoria for the potential of digital technologies not leading us again to naïve optimism, which in turn distracts us from real problems and leads architecture and …","date":1528536600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528536600,"objectID":"4fc6513dbaf0a41dc58ab2d4746caac2","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/event/continuum-architectonics/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/event/continuum-architectonics/","section":"event","summary":"Presentation at the symposium *The Architectonics of Virtual Space*.

It will be argued that we have a mental capacity, or power, that enables us to differentiate between directions in space. This capacity makes it possible for us to relate to spatial directions as real, and not merely virtual, reciprocal relations.","tags":["IAM Open Lectures","curatorial","IAM TU Graz"],"title":"IAM Open Lecture 22: On Real and Virtual Space","type":"curation"},{"authors":["Liss C.

And still, navigating through these virtual worlds (which are in many ways close simulations of our physical world) re-shapes our conception of space extremely. This presentation will have a closer look at how inhabiting virtual worlds comes about in phenomenological terms. Starting with the assumption that spatial conception is a function of our embodied existence, it explores how the use of technology alters our grasp of space.

But above all, Architecture is a way of seeing, thinking and questioning. By using the architectural gaze, language and mode of thinking, one can develop an approach, a form of investigation and analysis, which offers a set of tools for the deconstruction and reconstruction of meaning and its contingent nature. In a sense, we are in the realm of other kinds of architectures, of narratives created and dismantled through the vocabulary and syntax of Architecture, evading its original context and contaminating other disciplines with its core characteristics.

The most recent work, “Thing“, which — unlike De Clercq’s previous work, all of which was designed entirely in the computer — was made by scanning urban environments and transforming them into pointillist three-dimensional profiles of buildings and streetscapes, holding space together through the barest suggestion of form. The high-definition image is able to contain subtle clouds of tiny dots that transform the real into an astonishing realm between nothing and thing, absence and the presence of total possibility. De Clercq’s commitment to architectural and musical structure gives her explorations the rational grounding of the best science fiction: these are speculative yet fully immersive environments, amplified by meticulous soundtracks of musicians like Scanner and De Clercq’s frequent collaborator Anton Aeki.","tags":["IAM Open Lectures","curatorial","IAM TU Graz"],"title":"IAM Open Lecture 18: Architectonics : Film presentation \u0026 discussion","type":"curation"},{"authors":["Constantinos Miltiadis","Gerriet K.

Which would be the design principles of a new kind of architecture in this framework and from which materials would it be made of? Material engineering is nowadays a growing field and scientists are not only able to invent new materials but also to discover new properties of existing ones. Design applications of such materialities have been mostly developed in academia in the form of demonstrative prototypes, that vary from wearables, to small scale artistic installations. In architecture, the few experimental projects that have been realized, focus mostly on adaptive envelope skins or room separators, but no self-standing adaptive structure has been developed due to the difficulties of scaling up material properties.

Doktoratsschule, KUG)\n“The recorder in the 21st century”\nFrom the Middle Ages on, the recorder had many different forms of appearance and was always adapted to the sound worlds and music aesthetics of its particular time. Therefore, recorder players from today can choose from a big variety of instruments to perform in different styles and performance practises. So, it seems quite logic to perform music from today on instruments from today. But, reality looks different and in terms of method, extended techniques and performance practise on modern recorder models we are still at the starting point and there is a lot to develop, to explore, to fathom and to document. This fact marks the actual starting point of my artistic research and leads me the question: How much will new recorder models enrich repertoire, playing techniques and performance practise of recorder players?\nSusanne studied the recorder with P. Leenhouts at Amsterdam Conservatory, with G. Lünenbürger at the Berlin University of Arts and with J. Fischer at the Akademie für Tonkunst in Darmstadt. Since October 2015 she is doing an artistic-academic research on the Helder Tenor at the Kunstuniversität Graz. Susanne regularly performs recitals and teaches workshops in Europe and overseas. As founding member of the former recorder quartet QNG – Quartet New Generation, she appears both as soloist and different formations as well as music theatre productions. She has participated in numerous world premieres at renowned venues and festivals worldwide with e.g. Ensemble Adapter, Collegium Novum Zürich, Figura Ensemble, Ensemble ICTUS and Neue Vokalsolisten. Susanne has won several scholarships and international competitions in Berlin, Bonn, Cracow, Darmstadt, Göttingen, Graz, New York, and Rotterdam. She is living and teaching in Berlin and won a lectureship at the University of Arts in April 2010.\nMAS ETH AI Dipl. Constantinos Miltiadis (Institute of Architecture and Media, TU Graz)\n“Timescales of architecture”\nIn contrast to sound and music, architecture, understood primarily as the discipline of materialization of spatial designs, is traditionally thought of as an event of presence outside of the time dimension. The talk aims to examine different notions of a timeline in architecture history; from the timeless, to the periodic, metabolic and temporary, and eventually, through personal works and current research dealing with procedural design, interactive structures, virtual reality and game studies, present a conjecture of an immaterial but sensible architecture, of narrative events and interactive agency in contingent and subjective spatiotemporal environments.\nConstantinos Miltiadis is an architect, computational designer and researcher, currently a University Assistant at the Institute of Architecture and Media of TU Graz. His work is interdisciplinary and experimental, and focuses on real-time, interactive, virtual and augmented reality design as a means of expanding the scope of architecture. He holds an MAS in Architecture and Information from the Chair for CAAD of ETH Zurich and a Diploma in Architecture Engineering from the NTU-Athens. Constantinos has taught programming classes in academic environments, conferences and festivals, and has worked for various academic and research oriented practices. His work has been awarded in international competitions, presented in exhibitions and conferences, and published by between others The Guardian and Reuters.\n","date":1496080800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496080800,"objectID":"3652fde255b28f731b73bca93fb175ba","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/event/timescales-of-architecture/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/event/timescales-of-architecture/","section":"event","summary":"Presentation at the Signale Soirée, Institute for Electronic Music, KU Graz; 2017.","tags":["presentation","sound","IEM"],"title":"Timescales of Architecture","type":"event"},{"authors":["Marko Ciciliani"],"categories":["curatorial"],"content":" Marko Ciciliani is a composer, performer, researcher and audiovisual artist based in Austria.

GAPPP is a 3 year research project that started in 2016, and with a goal to investigate what aesthetic effect the use of elements from computer games can yield in the context of experimental audiovisual compositions. This project starts out with the assumption that player interactions and game strategies offer yet unexplored models that can be applied in live audiovisual works. The goal is to develop a thorough understanding of the potential of game based elements in performative experimental audiovisual works. The research is carried out from three perspectives, of 1) the audiovisual composer, 2) the performer, and 3) the audience. For our investigation, we commission audiovisual composers to write new works specifically for this research project. Subsequently the works are rehearsed and investigated during concentrated working periods. At the end of those working periods the works are performed with a “test”-audience which is required to give us feedback on how they experienced the pieces by filling in questionnaires. In addition, various interviews are conducted with composers, performers and audience members. A large number of data of different sorts has been accumulated during the first working periods, that took place since 2016. This talk will present the first findings, alongside various artistic examples from the project.","tags":["IAM Open Lectures","curatorial","IAM TU Graz"],"title":"IAM Open Lecture \u0026 Performance 9: CPPG Composition, Performance and Perception of Gamified Audiovisual Works","type":"curation"},{"authors":["Emma Fraser"],"categories":["curatorial"],"content":" Emma Fraser is a final year PhD candidate at the University of Manchester, researching video games, virtual architecture, and urban decay.

In particular, design practice and play practice can be interrogated through in-person encounters – both the playful navigation of ruinous cityscapes in games, and the dream-like exploration of actual cities using data and experiences that are derived from gameplay.

Not so much “here’s three chords, now form your band.” More like: “Here’s three gigs, now go form your autonomous art collective.” The new tactic might be more question of being metadata-punks.” (McKenzie Wark - Metadata Punk, 2015)1\nConstantinos Miltiadis, Dubravka Sekulić, and Marcell Mars are amateur librarians sharing and maintaining their collections at https://library.memoryoftheworld.org/. Like other amateur librarians they run away, on daily bases, from interesting, exciting professional duties into the boring acts of searching for new books available on the internet, meticulously editing their metadata, running optical character recognition against badly scanned books, slicing double-paged books into single-paged ready for screen. If an important author and her books are not already available on internet then they scan and make it available. Sometimes, not always, they also read, annotate, cite, and discuss with others.\nIn this tabletalk the three speakers will present different aspects of the inevitable role of a researcher as librarian. From the definition of a library, to the act of creating a public library and of making sense of one’s reading corpus. The talk will be followed by a workshop on Wednesday, to introduce book scanning methods, and software for annotating, citing and organizing libraries.\nMarcell Mars started his research “Ruling Class Studies” at Jan van Eyck (2011-12), continued at Akademie Schloss Solitude (2013) and since spring 2015, he is a PhD student at Leuphana University in DCRL (Digital Cultures Research Lab).

As with VSMS 2016, the course developed as final output interactive Virtual Reality applications in the format of videogames, focusing on perceptible and immaterial spatial concepts and experiences. The 2017 VSMS is titled “16m2 Labyrinths” given the physical space constraints (4x4m tracking space) of the HTC Vive VR system.\nThe aim of the studio is to approach Virtual Reality as a choropoietic medium, instead of a representational one, and explore from an architectural perspective, the possibility of designing spatial experiences that don’t rely on physical materiality but are however sensible. Our focus of exploring the architectural aesthetic potential of this medium was pursued by a wide variety of methods implemented in the student projects, ranging from the design of spatial narratives to navigable non-euclidean spaces and more abstract experiences.\nStarting from the concept of the Labyrinth the studio investigated the geometrical, formal, and organizational aspects of labyrinths and mazes, and through key readings from both architecture and game studies, how such concepts can be applied to spatio-temporal interactive environments, as an intention of approaching the videogame medium with an architectural sensibility, for developing novel architectural experiences.\nCourse details The course is going to work primarily with Unity 3D, 3D Max, and Premiere Pro. All course assignments and outputs are in digital form. No previous programming experience is necessary. Fluency with conventional 3D modelling, raster, and vector graphics software though is required.\nThe course includes the electives Digital Form and Motion taught by Oliver Reischl, and Interdisciplinary Media taught by Constantinos Miltiadis. The course is coordinated through a Slack group, collective readings performed through Hypothes.is.\nCourse language The studio as well as the electives are taught in English and are open to exchange students.\nReading assignments Ernest Adams – The role of architecture in videogames (2002) Espen J.

The research aims at building up the required body of knowledge for establishing an international discourse on agricultural design as part of the architectural discipline.\nDiederik de Koning graduated cum laude in architecture from Delft University of Technology, and also holds a master’s degree in Environmental and Infrastructure Planning from the University of Groningen. Since the spring of 2013 he has taught a variety of courses at The Berlage Center for Advanced Studies in Architecture and Urban Design in Delft. He now works for the Institute of Architecture and Landscape at Graz University of Technology. He is currently working on his PhD research at the Borders \u0026amp; Territories research group at TU Delft, which deals with agricultural buildings in the post-war European countryside. Results of the research have been presented at conferences in Warsaw and Venice in 2016. In parallel, he runs an independent architecture practice together with Laura van Santen under the name la-di-da (http://www.la-di-da.nl/) which was recently included as one of the 33 invited young Dutch and Flemish offices to present their work as part of the 2016 “MAATWERK/MASSARBEIT” exhibition at the Deutsches Architekturmuseum, Frankfurt.\nTToA 2 – Petra Eckhard: The Anti-canon of Architectural Modernism TToA 2 event poster Tuesday, 10.01.2017, 18:00 Kork, Lessingstraße 25, 8010 Graz In her talk Petra Eckhard will explore architectural structures located in the Western hemisphere which emerged during the second half of the 20th century as an anti-canon of modernist architecture. As manifestations of personal desires and individual creativity, the works analysed have been realised without the burden of economic, functional, temporal or aesthetic restrictions–aspects which usually accompany architectural practice. In their important function as foils, the anti-canonic works discussed unfold a special relationship to modernist forms, which paradoxically does both counteract and mirror the “greatness” and hubris associated with the modernist canon.\nPetra Eckhard is a literary and cultural studies scholar at the Institute of Architectural Theory, Art History and Cultural Studies at Graz University of Technology. She studied English and American Studies in New York, Bern and Graz, where she also received her doctorate in 2010. Her fields of interdisciplinary research involve practices of architectural writing, postmodernist works of literature and architecture as well as their cultural implications. She is the author of “Chronotopes of the Uncanny” (2011) and co-editor of Graz Architecture Magazine (GAM). Currently, she is working on her second book which explores the anti-canon of modernist architecture.\nTToA 3: Mars, Miltiadis, Sekulić – Metadata Punks TToA 3 event poster Tuesday, 21.03.2017, 18:00 Kork, Lessingstraße 25, 8010 Graz See Metadata Punks.\nTToA 4: Christoph Walter Pirker – Visual Ontologies of the Indefinite TToA 4 event poster Tuesday, 13.06.2017, 18:00 Kork, Lessingstraße 25, 8010 Graz In the epoch of the Anthropocene, human and non-human agencies are entangled in an extensive fabric, which determines the condition of our world. Such fabric is not balanced in a static equilibrium, but conceived as a flowing and intensive coexistence of currents and conditions, which define the expressions of our environment. The Anthropocene not only gains its geological importance by having inscribed the human’s impact in the geological strata of the planet, but similarly by formulating the conception of geological strata as artificial and virtual layers containing a productive, yet unknown potential.\nThe dynamic of the anthropocenic fabric brings about a new approach to ontogenesis, which no longer occurs by means of substantialist or hylomorphic principles, but through the process of becoming in the intra-action between the natural and the cultural, the …","date":1470400409,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691238809,"objectID":"a117ab991a880c60b58f9abd8680e7f1","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/project/16-tabletalks/","publishdate":"2016-08-05T15:33:29+03:00","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/project/16-tabletalks/","section":"project","summary":"Architectural research lecture series, Graz","tags":["curatorial","lecture series","Graz","TU Graz","architecture","research","collaboration"],"title":"Tabletalks on Architecture (2016-2017)","type":"project"},{"authors":["Werner Jauk"],"categories":["curatorial"],"content":"In the scope of the Virtual Spaces Master Studio, and the Interdisciplinary Media: Space to Sound, we are pleased to announce the IAM Open Lecture #2 by Prof. Werner Jauk, titled „Sound to (auditory) space“.\nWerner Jauk Psychologist working on experimental aesthetics, the hedonic control of explorative behaviour Musicologist working on music being a process of mediatization of expressive behaviour and its communicative function in everyday-life Media-artist working an experimental settings to perceive the process of extension of perception by media, which creates virtualities.\nDr. Werner Jauk, musician and artist, is the Professor of Musicology at the Karl Franz University of Graz.

The objective of the studio was to introduce virtual reality as a medium for experimental design, and to explore designing virtual environments in both space and time. At the end of the semester each student produced, presented, and exhibited a VR experience (for Gear VR and Kinect v2).\nType Master studio module; academic; master level Module courses Master design studio; Interdisciplinary Media elective; Architecture \u0026amp; Film elective Context Institute of Architecture and Media, TU Graz Module credits 16 ECTS Duration Full semester (summer semester 2016) Participants 13 (architecture students) Deliverables Individual VR application (Samsung Gear VR); video presentation; documentation booklet Exhibitions Graz Open Architecture Day; TU Graz VR Night Course information Course description\nVirtual Spaces Master Studio (VSMS) was an experimental VR game design course (16 ECTS master design studio module) taught during the summer semester of 2016 to a group of 13 architecture master students, at the Institute of Architecture and Media, Faculty of Architecture, TU Graz. The aim of the studio was to introduce architects to VR as a platform for experimental architectural design that doesn’t need to result in building form. The VSMS module included the electives “Interdisciplinary Media: Space to Sound” and “Architecture \u0026amp; Film”. The module was taught by Constantinos Miltiadis and Prof. Urs Hirschberg.\nWorking essentially in the videogame medium, the design approach of the studio is a fusion of disciplines, techniques, and skills that require the parallel development of both technical and conceptual tools such as concept design and narrative development, storyboarding, interaction design, UI design, 3d modeling, sound design, video editing, scripting, app development, etc. The course introduced theoretical discussions of culture and space, analyzing and drawing inspiration from diverse discourses including video games, films, novels, architecture, and critical theory. In addition to VR the students were asked to experiment with spatial evocations in other creative media such as text, sound, video, and 2D graphics.\nThe breadth of the 13 works developed by individual students demonstrates that VR and the videogame medium hold significant potential for architectural explorations of many different kinds, including the design of experienceable spatiotemporal environments that are impossible to come across in physical reality. Furthermore, the course showed that many aspects of designerly and tacit knowledges as well as technical design skills are well transferable between architecture and game design and development.\nCourse language The studio as well as the electives are taught in English.\nSetup The VR setup is wireless and full-body immersive, was based on project Anywhere (2014) and made use of GearVR headsets (courtesy of Drei Austria) deployed in a space tracked by Kinect V2 sensors which can follow 25 points of a user’s skeleton, synchronized with the android app through a web cloud in real-time.\nOutput All projects were made with Unity3D for Android/GearVR. All module output is digital.\nReview jury Final review (30.06.2016) : Jan Markus Ludwig (Wideshot), Lewis Scott (VizConnected), and Florian Fend (IAM).\nHardware The studio was sponsored by Drei Austria with four sets of GearVR headsets and Samsung Galaxy S6 smartphones.\nNote: The projects trailer video is a collage of video trailers of students’ projects.

Therefore, we proposed a fabrication method that was neither subtractive nor additive, but rather ‘formative’. The course explored the use of thermoplastic materials –polymers that become pliable above a specific temperature and solidify again when cooled down. For this, we created a setup where the thermoplastic sheet was fixed on a wooden frame mounted on the robot. A heat gun and a formative tool-tip were arranged in adjacent stations on the floor. The fabrication workflow had the robot moving the polymer sheet on top of the heat gun, where it was locally heated for a specific amount of time, and then moved over and pushed down the tool-tip, which like a mold, deformed a pliable area of the polymer sheet.\nThe course began with a series of tests to explore the behavior and tolerances of the mater against various parameters of head-induced deformation. The process generated a data set that described the tolerances of the material in regard to various tool tips, the height, angle and density of deformations, and the amount of heating required. This study informed the creation of parametric tools that assisted the material-specific design process and the automation of the fabrication process. In conjunction with the use of a 7-axis Kuka robot, this allowed us to design and fabricate with a high degree of controlled variation at the threshold of the material’s tolerances.\nThe course participants developed a panel-based construction consisting of 32 40×40 cm modules arranged in a 4x8 grid. The patterned surfaces were designed using a coplex system of probabilistic distributions developed in Wolfram Mathematica and Grasshopper. Lastly, the robot control code was generated using the KUKA|prc Grasshopper plug-in.\nExtensile was presented at the Chair for Computer Aided Architectural Design on 11.06.2015\nCredits Students Despoina Pippa, Christoph Zechmeister, José Algeciras, Alina Kvirkveliya, Tsung-Hsun Ku, Apostolos Apostolinas, Anna Maragkoudaki\nVideo credits Camera: Anna Maragkoudaki, Achilleas Xydis\nEditing: Anna Maragkoudaki\nSound: Blank Banshee 0: B- Start Up\nWorkshop instructors Achilleas Xydis\nMariana Popescu\nConstantinos Miltiadis\n","date":1431005987,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1431005987,"objectID":"71132d449fe6c5b89c579587ebc7b8e2","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/course/extensile/","publishdate":"2015-05-07T16:39:47+03:00","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/course/extensile/","section":"course","summary":"Two-week robotic fabrication workshop.

Each T-shirt represents a specific instrument and all together form a rock ensemble. Through the seemingly magical clothes that produce sound by touch, the project brings to children an interactive musical game, encouraging and stimulating their musical interest as well as collaboration with each other to perform music. The project was developed by textile designer Selina Reiterer and computational designer Constantinos Miltiadis for exploring playful applications of smart materials and interactive wearable technology.\nThe project includes three T-shirts, a microcontroller with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module, and a mobile app.\nThe three individual T-shirts were inspired by and designed after the standard rock trio representing a guitar, a bass, and a drum set. Each shirt has a distinct pattern, based on the attributes of the instrument it represents, which each shape forming a uniform conductive region sensitive to touch. The patterns were silk-screen printed on plain T-shirts with electrically conductive paint, a flexible, washable and non-toxic chemical mixture.\nIn the back of each garment is a removable pocket with an Arduino microcontroller that receives touch signals from each shape through conductive thread.\nThe touch signals are then sent wirelessly via BLE to a mobile application which triggers different audio samples corresponding to each garment-instrument. Multiple T-shirts can be connected to a single mobile device, or each band member can use their own. The device can be connected with headphones and external speakers to amplify the sound output.\nAdditional information “John Paul George \u0026amp; Me” was exhibited at the 2015 Maker Faire in Rome. The project received the 2nd prize in the YouReshape wearable technology competition (archived) in August 2015.

The concept behind the backpack sensor prototype was to develop a mobile sensor unit to measure, analyse and correlate both ambient and biometric data from a subject’s itinerary in an urban context, and eventually correlate environmental qualities with psychosomatic effects.\nThe ESUM backpack sensor prototype was developed and documented with the intention to be easily replicated by the different research labs associated with the project. It includes several off the shelf electronics components, a custom housing that can fit in a small backpack, and custom software for logging sensor values. The software was developed as a Visual Studio C# console application, and is responsible for synchronous data logging from the different sensor units with varying frequencies and temporal dependencies – sensor fusion and analysis was implemented via machine learning at a later stage of the project (see Ojha et al. 2019).1 The ESUM case is made from plywood and plexiglas, and can be laser cut and assembled in less than 1 hour.\nThis work is part of ESUM­-Analysing trade­offs between the energy and social performance of urban morphologies, a joint project between the Chair of Information Architecture, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland and the Chair of Computer Science for Architecture, Bauhaus ­University Weimar; supported by the Swiss SNF and the German DFG funding programs.\nESUM backpack prototype Prototype parts Barebone PC Battery unit Emotiv Epoc+ 16 point wireless EEG Libelium Meshlium WiFi sniffer Empatica E4 biometric watch (electrodermal activity, photoplethysmography, peripheral temperature, motion) GPS unit Atmospheric pressure sensor Temperature sensor Humidity sensor O3 sensor Air pollutants sensor I (C4H10, CH3CH2OH, H2, CO, CH4) Air pollutants sensor II (C6H5CH3, H2S, CH3CH2OH, NH3, H2) CO2 sensor NO2 sensor Sound pressure sensor Luminosity sensor Dust sensor ESUM project description2 In this research project, we investigate the impacts of urban morphology (UM) on citizen’s social potential as a function of accessibility and perception and compare it with the impacts of UM on building energy consumption for parallel case studies in Zürich Switzerland and Weimar Germany. This is of particular interest since urban planning decisions of urban morphology have long–term implications that affect not only the energy performance of the building stock but also on people’s experiential quality of the city environment.\nIn order to understand, measure and predict the impacts of UM on the perception of citizens we developed a three-tiered empirical study, which draws upon the participants’ experiences in a real-world experiment, along with two controlled experiments using a 360­degree video and a gray-scaled 3D virtual reality (VR) model of the city. All three experiments are conducted using the same pre­defined path in each of the two cities, for a total of six participant based experiments. In each experiment, the participants subjectively rate the urban environment through surveys for an understanding of their explicit perception.\nWe also go beyond subjective impression ratings to gain further insight into the implicit perception of the participants by simultaneously measuring electro-dermal activity (EDA) data collected via wearable devices. The EDA data is processed to quantify the frequency, duration, and location of arousals along the experimental path to show a measure of excitation. The explicit perception data provides the sentiment of the experience such as spacious/narrow, beautiful/ugly, or private/public (among others) while the implicit perception provides the “raw” arousal-based perception from participants.\nWe also consider the impacts of urban environment features on perception, including temperature, illuminance, sound, and dust using data collected via a “sensor-backpack,” specifically designed for the use in the real-world participant studies. The data produced from this experiment is highly complex; the seven sensors have varying frequencies and varying temporal dependencies. We, therefore, developed an information fusion mechanism to combine the spatial-temporal data to produce a structured dataset, which is analyzed using four state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms. The quantified physiological responses or “human perception” data are paired with the sensor-based environmental measurements using Machine Learning based knowledge discovery approaches. These include classification, fuzzy rule-based inference, feature selection, and clustering to derive underlying relationships between participants’ physiological response and environmental conditions. The results indicate that the participant’s implicit responses are affected by both urban …","date":1425635762,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1425635762,"objectID":"c738c863faa2f677c1738fbab284b50a","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/project/esum/","publishdate":"2015-03-06T12:56:02+03:00","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/project/esum/","section":"project","summary":"Design, development, and documentation of a mobile sensor unit prototype.

Sutherland, The Ultimate Display 1965)\nproject Anywhere is a framework and proof-of-concept prototype for full-body interactive wireless VR, developed at the Chair for CAAD, ETH Zurich in 2014, to investigate notions of virtual space and time, and to explore designing synthetic spatiotemporal sensory experiences. The project was initiated in mid-2014, following the release of the first commercial VR devices that featured limited bodily involvement and capacity for movement. Addressing these limitations, this project developed a VR framework consisting of a mobile application, custom wireless VR HMDs and data glove prototypes as well as skeleton tracking, to produce a vivid real-time interactive presence in a virtual reality environment In that, project Anywhere demonstrates the potential of virtual space as a valid architectural medium in itself (instead of its use as an intermediary form for design or visualization), that allows experimenting with synthetic kinaesthetic, visual and auditory sensory experiences. Concurrently it explores the capacity of designing spatiotemporal environments with an embedded dimension of time. The project’s title, “Anywhere”, refers to the generic nature of the digital-virtual environment that can be made to simulate any physical context: real or imaginary.\nVideo demo Project description The project consists of the following bespoke software and hardware prototypes:\na mobile multiplayer VR app, Omnimask: a 3D printed mobile VR head-mount , Inteligloves: a pair of custom wireless data gloves, and Omnitracker: a sensor fusion software. The main component of the project is a custom mobile application (1) developed in Unity as a multiplayer VR videogame. Mounted on a VR mask (2), the app provides a stereoscopic viewport for each individual user, through the point of view of their avatar in the shared virtual environment.\nEach user’s spatial presence is tracked in real-time by their head-mount, data gloves, and a Kinect skeleton tracking sensor. Cumulatively, head, gesture and skeleton tracking provide 86 degrees of freedom, fused together by the Omnitracker (4), a software written in Java/Processing. These data are synchronized with a web cloud and are use to animate the user’s avatar in real-time (see image13).1 Thus, any movement of the subject in physical space, such as walking, or even head tilting and finger movement correlates 1:1 to movements of their avatar.\nHardware prototypes developed for this project include a 3D printed VR head-mount (2) and a pair of data gloves (3). The VR head-mount was designed for an iPhone 5, and featured adjustable inter-pupillary distance, and focal length.\nThe data gloves (3) were developed using Arduino microcontrollers. Each glove features an XBEE transceiver module, a 9 DoF sensor, and up to 6 flex sensors (for tracking individual finger movement). These were mounted on a lightweight elastic 3D printed glove base, easily adjustable for different hand sizes. The framework was programmed to recognize hand gestures, used for performing various contextual virtual actions (see for example image 8), proving that a virtual presence can also be an active one.\nRelated publications Constantinos Miltiadis (2016).

The aim of the project was the production of a proof-of-concept for an architectural structure able to interact and reconfigure itself according to parameters of its immediate environment and different use scenarios. The concept for this work departed from the design flexibility of parametric design methods, and the intention of maintaining such flexibility as responsiveness even after the course of the design process:\nWhat if we could transform the object of architecture from the design of the defined to the design of the unpredictable? Video demo Project description The main component of the project is a custom software written in the Processing programming language. The software was responsible for the computational modeling of the structure, real-time interaction, and visualization (see video demo). The project also includes a functional physical modeling prototype with stepper motors and custom extendable beams developed with Arduino-based electronics, and controlled in real-time by the Processing software (see image 9). Moreover, a parametric CAD model developed in Rhino and Grasshopper was responsible for generating 3D models of instances of the structure using data forwarded by the Processing software via OSC. These were used to generate 3D renderings and 3D prints.\nThe structure itself consists of two parallel grids: a triangular grid at the bottom and a hexagonal grid at the top. The two grids comprise of extendable beams. These are connected to each other with fixed-length beams, while all joints allow for free rotation. The structure is supported by vertical extendable beams at the outline of the lower grid. This configuration makes up a rigid spaceframe which can be deformed while maintaining structural integrity by altering the beam lengths of the two parallel grids (see image 3). The structural deformation solver was modeled using a mathematical equation based on triple-sphere intersection. The structural detailing of the project provisioned for pneumatic extendable beams, and explored three types of joints using antiprism nodes with universal mechanical joints, ball joints, and solid elastic polymers (see project booklet).\nThe project investigated two distinct use scenarios: playful interaction with people and adaptation to environmental conditions.\nThe first scenario produced continuous animations and transformations the structure according to the movements and densities of people under it in real-time, thus in a way encourage playful interaction between people in public space (see image 5). This was modeled virtually using a boid system, and was demonstrated live using a Kinect (spatial scanning) sensor.\nThe second made use of a solar radiation model that would calculate the position of the sun for a particular geolocation so that the structure would adapt accordingly to generate the maximum possible area of shade at any given moment of time (see image 6).\nMoreover, the project explored a range of possible configurations of the structure based on various mathematical equations such as hyperbolic paraboloid and monkey saddle surfaces as well as various trigonometric equations (see 3D renderings below).\nProject information Interactive Kinetic Structures was developed in 2012 as a diploma thesis project at NTU-Athens, under the supervision of Prof. Dimitris Papalexopoulos. It was presented to a four-memeber jury in October 2012 and graded 10/10.\nThe project was one of the finalists of the international competition ALGODeQ: Algorithmic Design Quest in 2013.\nA paper based on this project was presented at the 2013 eCAADE conference at TU Delft, in September 2013.\nCredits Concept \u0026amp; development\nConstantinos Miltiadis\nSupervision\nDimitris Papalexopoulos\nAdditional support\nPetros Koutsolambros, Ero Papavasiliou, Spyros Efthymiou, Eliza Neophytou, Antonis Tzortzis, Serafeim Matzoufas, Antreas Alygizos\nImages ","date":1349856833,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1349856833,"objectID":"ea0b76506b64892f4dca21502333caeb","permalink":"https://cmiltiadis.github.io/website-hugo-academic/project/iks/","publishdate":"2012-10-10T11:13:53+03:00","relpermalink":"/website-hugo-academic/project/iks/","section":"project","summary":"Interactive kinetic structure prototype.
