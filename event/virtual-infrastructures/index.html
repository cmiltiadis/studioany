<p>The <em>Open Up and Shape Helsinki</em> Symposium discusses how equity, labour, money and structures of power are configured globally, while reflecting these questions back onto Helsinki’s cultural scene, inviting three position papers and three Helsinki-based respondents:</p>
<p>Carolina Rito, co-editor of Institution as <a href="https://www.sternberg-press.com/product/institution-as-praxis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>Praxis – New Curatorial Directions for Collaborative Research</strong></em></a> (Sternberg Press, 2020); followed by Joasia Krysia, Curator of Helsinki Biennial 2023</p>
<p>Bassam El Baroni, editor of <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/between-material-and-possible" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>Between the Material and the Possible: Infrastructural Re-Examination and Speculation in Art</strong></em></a> (Sternberg Press and Edith Russ Haus, 2022); in with architect and researcher Constantinos Miltiadis</p>
<p>Cynthia Cruz, author of <a href="https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-melancholia-of-class-a-manifesto-for-the-working-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>The Melancholia of Class: A Manifesto for the Working Class</strong></em></a> (Repeater Books, 2021); with poet and novelist Niko Hallikainen</p>
<p>On Friday 10th Justina Zubaitė-Bundzė, Helen Kaplinsky, Maria Mkrtycheva, Irina Mutt and Henri Terho will participate in a public panel discussion around the three focuses of the Symposium: Infrastructures of power, and (re-) distribution; class, money and access; institutional reimagining and future publics.</p>
<p>In conjunction with <a href="https://www.shape-helsinki.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SHAPE</strong></a>, a mapping of art spaces and public events across the city, initiated in 2021 by PUBLICS and Kohta, the Symposium offers a platform for voicing individual and common challenges. Over 100 Helsinki-based art organisations and institutions have been invited to join in <em>Rants &amp; Raves</em> of four minutes and thirty-three seconds each, inspired by John Cage’s composition 4’33’’. ‘Ranting’ and ‘Raving’ are immediate and liberating forms of public expression. They tell about the present, while pointing at long-coming conditions of pressure, uncertainty and search for alternatives.</p>
<p><em>Rants &amp; Raves</em> will form a choral, humorous and situated picture of Helsinki’s art scene; reflected by curator, artist and educator Dahlia El Broul, chair of the board at Catalysti, and Henna Harri, director of the Association of Photographic Artistsand Photographic Gallery Hippolyte.</p>
<p>The <em>Open Up and Shape Helsinki</em> Symposium programme is planned in collaboration with <a href="https://kohta.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kunsthalle Kohta</strong></a> in the framework of the three-year <a href="https://openupeu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Open Up</strong></a> (Creative Europe) project, for which PUBLICS is a partner. Through <em>Open Up and Shape Helsinki</em>, PUBLICS will map out, invite, and nurture new audiences for its activities. <a href="https://frame-finland.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Frame Contemporary Art Finland</strong></a> joins the collaboration by co-hosting one session in the context of <em>Rehearsing Hospitalities</em> public programme.</p>

<p><strong>Ilona Sagar</strong>, lives and works in London. Using a diverse range of media spanning moving-image, text, performance and assemblage, she has formed a body of work which responds to the social and historic context found in the public and private spaces we inhabit. By instrumentalising historical archives and their institutions, not as an encounter with a safely sealed past, but as something current and unstable that speaks urgently to our present condition, she explores the links between language, surface, technologies and the body through our increasingly mediated encounters in social, political and experiential space. Ilona Sagar is the Stanley Picker Arts Fellow 2021 and the Saastamoinen Foundation, Helsinki, artist in residence for 2022. Forthcoming commissions include ‘The Radio Ballads’ Serpentine Gallery, where she is one of four new commissions with Sonia Boyce, Helen Cammock and Rory Pilgrim (2021/22), and is embarking on a new solo commission with Firstsite Gallery, Colchester (2023).</p>
